Cystic fibrosis is currently the most common fatal hereditary disease
of the Caucasian race.  The lack of effective oral antibiotics
against Pseudomonas aeruginosa precludes either systemic treatment or
suppression, in an outpatient setting, of the chronic pseudomonas
bronchitis typically seen in CF patients.  Because of the central
role of infection, and particularly pseudomonas infection, in the
sequence of events that leads to respiratory failure and death in CF,
currently available information regarding the pathogenesis of
infections caused by P. aeruginosa was emphasized and discussed at a
workshop on infections in patients with CF, sponsored by the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md., on
January 9 and 10, 1979.
