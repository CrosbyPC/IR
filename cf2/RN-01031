The central problem of the mid-20th century genetic counselor has
been to determine the place of the genes in the origin of complex
human characteristics - such as neural tube defects, cleft palate,
diabetes, and congenital heart disease - in short, the major
malformation and polygenic syndromes which make up the bulk of what
we call birth defects.  Of comparable importance in terms of genetic
counseling is understanding the origin and incidence of the newly
recognized genetic heterogeneity lying behind what had previously
been regarded as simple, single-gene determined diseases.  Topics
include dealing with genetic heterogeneity, phenotypes and genotypes,
where genetic causation defies simple analysis, and sources of
variation.  Behavior disorders with presumptive single-gene causation
(Lesch-Nyhan disease), presumptive sex-linked causation
(aggressivity), and presumptive polygenic causation (alcoholism) are
also discussed.
