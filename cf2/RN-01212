The relationship between the activity of the cystic fibrosis serum
ciliary dyskinesia factor, detected by the rabbit tracheal bioassay,
and clinical status of the patient has been investigated in children,
1-24 years old, with cystic fibrosis. No significant correlation was
found between the amount of serum factor activity and age, clinical
status assessed by the Schwachman score, pulmonary function (vital
capacity, functional residual capacity, total lung capacity, residual
volume, maximum breathing capacity, maximal midinspiratory flow, and
maximal midexpiratory flow) or blood gas levels (pCO2, pO2). The
activity showed no significant relationship to serum
galactosyltransferase activity in children with cystic fibrosis.
