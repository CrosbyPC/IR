In 1977, we demonstrated the efficiency of autogenic drainage with
two bronchorrheic children, who needed bronchography for diagnostic
purposes.  This demonstration was made possible thanks to a
radiocinematographic study after bronchography.  The examination also
showed the inefficacy of coughing.  The object of the present study
is to analyze the physiologic mechanism of autogenic drainage.  For
children older than five, this method is very simple and efficient
and as the effort or onset is not excessive and as expiration does
not need to be complete, autogenic drainage is not exhausting and can
be performed for a long time, which is indispensable since the
progression of secretions is slow.
