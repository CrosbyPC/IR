1. The mucus glycoproteins in meconium from normal infants and from
infants having cystic fibrosis with meconium ileus have been studied.
2. Whereas normal meconium contained about 50% protein-bound
carbohydrate, the meconium from cystic fibrosis contained only about
10%. 3. Glycopolypeptides were prepared from the mucus of
glycoproteins. The oligosaccharide units from this material were
released and fractionated. The fractions ranged widely in size and
composition. 4. The fractions from cystic fibrosis specimens had a
significantly higher content of fucose than those from normal
specimens.
