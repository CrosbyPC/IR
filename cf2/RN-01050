A study of erythrocyte fatty acids, adenosinetriphosphatase and
acetylcholinesterase in cystic fibrosis.

ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE: bl.  ADENOSINE-TRIPHOSPHATASE: bl.
CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: bl.  ERYTHROCYTES: me.  FATTY-ACIDS-UNSATURATED: bl.

ARACHIDONIC-ACIDS: bl.  HUMAN.  LINOLEIC-ACIDS: bl.

1. The proportions of both saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids
were measured in the erythrocytes in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients
along with two membrane bound enzymes ATPase and
acetylcholinesterase. Linoleic acid was found to be significantly
decreased and arachidonic acid increased in CF patients. The
proportion of saturated fatty acids were not significantly different
from the controls. Only adenosinetriphosphatase activity was found to
be reduced and not acetylcholinesterase in CF patients.
