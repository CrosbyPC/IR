The mucosal epithelium of the middle ear and Eustachian tube is in
direct continuity with the upper respiratory tract. Since the
otolaryngological aspects of cystic fibrosis (CF) are dominated by
involvement of the paranasal sinuses, it might be assumed that
children with CF would be expected to have a higher than usual
incidence of middle ear disease. Eighty patients who were afflicted
with CF had audiological evaluations, which consisted of hearing
threshold levels (250 to 8,000 Hz) and speech and impedance
audiometry. We found no greater incidence of a conductive or
sensorineural hearing loss in patients with CF when compared with a
normal age-adjusted population.
