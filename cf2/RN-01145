As the pathogenesis in cystic fibrosis (CF) has been considered to
lie in a disturbance in the behavior of secretions, particularly
mucins, from exocrine glands, it has been proposed that an alteration
in surface topography (form, number or distribution of microvilli or
blebs) of epithelial cells lining ducts could impair distribution
leading to retention of mucus leading to the clinical phenotype.
Scanning electronmicroscopy of human epithelial suspension cultures
now offers an opportunity to evaluate the role of plasmalemma
topography in CF.
