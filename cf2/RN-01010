Antimicrobial susceptibilities of rough, smooth, and mucoid colony
types of Pseudomonas isolated from cystic fibrosis patients.

ANTIBIOTICS: pd.  CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: mi.  PSEUDOMONAS: de.

HUMAN.  PSEUDOMONAS: cy.  SPUTUM: mi.

Minimal inhibitory concentrations of carbenicillin, chloramphenicol,
tetracycline, gentamicin, tobramycin, and trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole were determined for rough, smooth, and mucoid
Pseudomonas sp. isolates from sputa collected from 40 cystic
fibrosis patients.  Ninety-four percent of the minimal inhibitory
concentrations obtained by using mixed inocula of colonies of
different morphological types fell within one serial dilution of the
most resistant minimal inhibitory concentration obtained when each
colony type was tested separately.
