This study examined whether biologic activation of C3 with subsequent
pulmonary inflammation takes place in the lungs of patients with
cystic fibrosis.  Plasma complement C3 levels were all normal.
Eleven of the patients with the C3 split product C3c were from the
group of 14 patients suffering from chronic infection with mucoid
strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 2 were from the group of 14 CF
patients without P. aeruginosa infection.  This difference was
significant (p < 0.002).  A comparison of albumin ratios between the
13 patients with the C3 split product C3c and the remaining other 15
patients showed a significant higher ratio in the former group (p <
0.01) on an average 4.1 versus 1.4 per cent.  The significantly
higher albumin ratio demonstrated in the patients with C3c in their
sputum sol phase supports the concept of complement-induced
inflammation with subsequent transudation of plasma proteins in these
patients.  This study thus shows that complement-mediated
inflammatory reactions may play an important role in the pathogenesis
of pulmonary tissue damage in patients with CF, even when the plasma
C3 levels are normal, and it supports the concept of chronic P.
aeruginosa lung infection as an immune complex disease in CF
patients.
