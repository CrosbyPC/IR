We examined the age dependence of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme
(SACE) activity in healthy controls.  While we found no age
dependence in controls older than 20 years, those under 20 had much
increased SACE values.  We feel that it is inappropriate to evaluate
SACE activity in patients under 20 years old with diagnostic criteria
determined in adults. - Dr Romer and colleagues reported high
activities of SACE in 3 patients out of 10 with chronic granulomatous
disease (CGD) and concluded that "CGD is associated with increased
levels of SACE".  Unfortunately, Romer et al. did not study an
adequate paedeatric age control group, and their mean values are
compared primarily with that in 5 children with cystic fibrosis.  Our
most recent studies confirm our earlier observation that children
under the age 19 years definitely have higher mean SACE values than
do adults.  Cystic-fibrosis patients should not be used for
comparison since they tend to have lower SACE levels than comparable
aged controls.  In my opinion patients with CGD, according to the
data published by Romer et al., show no increase in SACE levels for
their age.
