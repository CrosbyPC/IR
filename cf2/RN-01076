The short circuit current rat jejunum bioassay, first employed in an
attempt to discern the cystic fibrosis (CF) serum "factor," was
evaluated using sera from patients with pancreatic disease.  The
data suggest other pancreatic diseases, specifically genetic
diabetes and alcoholic pancreatitis, also present with a serum
"factor" (or "factors") which reduce the short circuit current of
rat jejunum, an effect very similar to that of the CF serum
"factor."  A large number of sera from presumed normal subjects also
exhibited a significant reduction in short circuit current; these
(false positives) represent a yet to be defined mechanism, however,
they do decrease the likelihood that the observed effect is merely
due to pancreatic destruction.  Detailed procedure and equipment
specifications for the bioassay system are included.
