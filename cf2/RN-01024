It is confirmed that the level of alkaline phosphatase in fibroblasts
derived from cystic fibrosis patients can be induced many-fold by
growing the cells in the presence of Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein. It
is further shown that normal fibroblasts produce a "CF corrective
factor" which markedly inhibits this phenomenon. These observations
support a previous hypothesis on the nature of the metabolic defect
in cystic fibrosis.
