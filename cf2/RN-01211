The fact that alpha2-macroglobulin and cystic fibrosis CDA are made
by fibroblasts and monocytes points to the fact that these markers
and the CF protein will be of value for the detection of the CF gene
antenatally.  Screening for CFP and CF-CDA by isoelectric focusing or
radioimmunoassay in conjunction with quantitation of the functional
capacity of A2M could distinguish a fetus homozygous from one
heterozygous for the CF gene.
