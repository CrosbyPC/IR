We have been utilizing a patient's individual pharmacokinetic profile
to plan and monitor aminoglycoside therapy, and we have often noted
what appeared to be an extremely rapid elimination rate of gentamicin
in our patients with cystic fibrosis.  The patients with cystic
fibrosis had significantly greater renal and total clearances than
those without cystic fibrosis.  If this observation could be extended
to other drugs (such as the aminoglycosides), which are not normally
subject to renal secretion, it would prove intriguing evidence for a
possible primary renal defect in these patients.
