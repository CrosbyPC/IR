Bronchial secretions from 207 children suffering from various
pulmonary diseases and from 15 healthy controls were tested
concentration of IgA, IgG, lactoferrin and lysozyme. The results
obtained suggest that in many cases of chronic lung diseases in
children the levels of lactoferrin and immunoglobulins, especially
secretory IgA, are very low. In severe infections (cystic fibrosis,
bronchiectases) significant increase of IgG concentration was
observed.
