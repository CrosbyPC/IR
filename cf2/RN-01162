In recent years, several workers have reported that a single 2-hour
postprandial total serum bile acid (TSBA) concentration, in a variety
of liver disease states, is a more sensitive index of deranged liver
function than are the 'conventional' serum liver function tests.
This observation seemed to us to provide a challenging situation for
the assessment of TSBA concentrations in cystic fibrosis.  The
distribution of results for the CF patients (mean TSBA concentration
27.0 micromol/l) and for the age-matched controls (mean concentration
19.9 micromol/l) shows a wider range for the CF group.  Statistical
analysis, however, of these two groups shows no significant
difference between them.  Many factors affect both the size and
distribution of the bile acid pool in CF, and a consideration of
these factors may go some way towards explaining the rather
unspectacular TSBA results.
