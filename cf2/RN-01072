We wish to demonstrate that an abnormal thermostability has been
found in crude extracellular fluids for alpha-mannosidase.  More
extensive studies involving several of the 'leaky' hydrolases are
under way and they indicate that the observed thermolabilities can
be exploited to develop the urgently needed simple diagnostic tools
for cystic fibrosis.
