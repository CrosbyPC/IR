Dried blood spot screening for cystic fibrosis [letter].

We have measured immunoreactive trypsin IRT activity in dried blood
spot samples and have found abnormally high levels in infants with
cystic fibrosis (CF).  We agree with Crossley et al. that this test
deserves further investigation as a screen for CF in the newborn.
The low value for the 94 week infant is consistent with their finding
that, in children with low pancreatic enzyme output, the increased
IRT results are restricted to the first few months of life.  It
remains to be proved whether older CF patients with residual
pancreatic enzyme secretion do indeed continue to have increased IRT
levels.  If they do, the IRT test would also deserve further
investigation as a tool, to be used in conjunction with stool
pancreatic enzyme activity, in smaller centres who have had problems
with inaccurate sweat tests.
