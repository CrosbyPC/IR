Meconium specimens from more than 200 normal and premature and from 5
cystic fibrosis newborns were analyzed for their level of several
glycosidases.  Considerable scatter of activities were found in all
three groups studied and no evidence for any relation of such scatter
with the blood group-specific A, B, AB, H substances was found.
Alpha-glucosidase, an acid glycosidase found elevated in CF serum and
fibroblasts, was elevated in all CF meconium extracts including that
which had a very low albumin content.
