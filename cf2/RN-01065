Infection with the gram-negative bacillus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is
less common than infections with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella
pneumoniae, and Proteus sp; however, the mortality associated with
pseudomonas sepsis exceeds that found with the more commonly isolated
gram-negative bacilli by a considerable margin.  While explanations
exist for this increased virulence of pseudomonas, including
secretions of toxic exoproducts and a high degree of antibiotic
resistance, the precise reasons for such unfavorable clinical
experience with this organism are uncertain.  The current interest in
pseudomonas infection is partly due to the ever-increasing numbers of
immunosuppressed and granulocytopenic patients seen in clinical
practice.  The organism, pathogenesis, clinical presentations (burn
patients, nosocomial infections, immunosuppressed patients, cystic
fibrosis), and therapy are discussed.
