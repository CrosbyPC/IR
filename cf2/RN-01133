Serum-immunoreactive-trypsin (I.R.T.) was measured in children with
cystic fibrosis (C.F.) and a variety of controls. In the first few
months of life all C.F. children had a raised serum-I.R.T. A dried
blood-spot assay for I.R.T. was established and has potential as a
screening test for C.F. in the newborn.
