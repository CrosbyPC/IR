Inborn errors of metabolism are conditions in which the body fails to
metabolise certain chemicals due to an inherited enzyme deficiency.
The inborn errors of metabolism considered in this paper are those
which affect the metabolism of dietary nutrients and which require
manipulation of the carbohydrate intake.  In these cases the need for
sugar - either as a source of energy when other energy-supplying
nutrients have to be suppressed, or for the control of hypoglycaemia
- is vitally important.  Inborn errors of protein metabolism include
phenylketonuria, maple-syrup urine disease, organic acidaemias, and
hyperammonaemia.  Inborn errors of fat metabolism  include
abetalipoprotinaemia, type I lipoprotein-lipase deficiency, and
lymphangiectasia.  Inborn errors of carbohydrate metabolism include
diabetes, galactosaemia, fructosaemia, and glucose-6-phosphate
deficiency (type I glycogen storage disease).  Inborn errors of
multiple nutrients include cystic fibrosis.  Dietary carbohydrate,
psychological considerations, and dental caries are examined.
