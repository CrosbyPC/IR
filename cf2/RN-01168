Elliott's works, together with the previous works of several authors
reporting low essential fatty acid concentrations in the serum lipids
of patients with cystic fibrosis, stimulated us to make a pilot study
treating older CF patients with Intralipid for 1 year.  We found no
side effects in treating older CF patients with Intralipid for 1
year.  On the other hand the objective benefit was very limited and
today confusing, i.e., only a slight but significant improvement in
the renal sodium excretion after an oral sodium load was found.  The
relevance of this is speculative.
