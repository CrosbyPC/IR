One breath at a time: a family teaching program for children with
cystic fibrosis.

We have found patients who have cystic fibrosis to be very special
people; they have to overcome apparently insurmountable odds.  Our
teaching program comes from a basic belief that with support,
encouragement and affection, information and a focus on the positive
aspects of life, a person with CF can live well, even if only one
breath at a time.
