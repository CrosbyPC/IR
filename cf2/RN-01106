25-Hydroxycholecalciferol levels in patients with cystic fibrosis.

Assessment of the status of circulating vitamin D in cystic fibrosis
patients was investigated by determining serum levels of
25-hydroxycholecalciferol.  The majority of the patients with CF and
pancreatic insufficiency had levels of 25-OH-D within the normal
range.  Clinical symptoms or pathologic signs resulting from
deficiencies of vitamins A and E in patients with CF have been
repeatedly documented.  In contrast, a paradoxical lack of vitamin D
deficiency signs has been observed in CF patients.  This is
especially puzzling since rickets had been commonly associated with
most other forms of steatorrhea.  We can only speculate why rickets
was formerly rarely reported in association with CF.  Perhaps because
of voracious appetites and the selective absorption of vitamin D via
the lymphatics without requiring esterification, these individuals
were spared clinical rickets.
