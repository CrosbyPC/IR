On exposure to pancreatic extract (PE), four parents of cystic
fibrosis (CF) children developed immediate hypersensitivity-like
symptoms: i.e. rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma, and/or anaphylaxis. IgE
to PE was demonstrated in the subjects by skin testing, leucocyte
histamine release and radioallergosorbent test (RAST). No serum
precipitating antibodies were found. Bronchial challenge caused an
immediate asthmatic response. No delayed asthmatic response or
hypersensitivity pneumonitis-like reaction occurred. The responsible
antigen for PE induced asthma is unknown; trypsin failed to inhibit
PE-RAST and is therefore not responsible in these subjects. Caution
should be exercised in using PE for skin testing and bronchial
challenge in subjects with suspected hypersensitivity to PE. Certain
measures were found useful in preventing the occurrence of symptoms
in the four subjects.
