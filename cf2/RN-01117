We have also found a significant difference between the 6-hour
urinary PABA recovery in healthy controls and CF patients, with no
overlap of the ranges, and a good correlation with fecal chymotrypsin
activity.  We can stress the usefulness of the test in this age
group.  In studying a group of healthy newborn infants, however, the
results were quite different: The PABA recovery was smaller and
showed greater variations and overlap with results in CF patients
occurred.  It is clear that the test is not applicable in newborn
infants when performed in the described manner.  One possible
explanation is the physiologically limited glomerular filtration rate
in the newborn infant, which could have delayed the PABA excretion.
