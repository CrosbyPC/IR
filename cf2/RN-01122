Sweat tests [letter].

CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: di.  SWEAT: an.

HUMAN.

I agree that sweat tests are frequently not performed reliably, but I
wonder why the clinical chemist has been singled out as being
responsible when most hospital laboratories are still directed by
pathologists and not by professional clinical chemists.  In addition
to our laboratory, I know of many other hospital clinical chemistry
laboratories in which the test is being performed properly.
Furthermore, the Pediatric Committee of the American Association for
Clinical Chemistry is working on a review article for the journal,
Clinical Chemistry, regarding the correct way the sweat test should
be run.  Clearly, clinical chemists do not "lack interest."
