We measured immunoreactive trypsin (IRT) concentrations in 32
patients with established cystic fibrosis and in 16 parents
(heterozygotes) of patients with CF.  29 patients (91%) and 6 parents
(38%) had abnormal trypsin concentrations.  We found that in only 3
out of the 29 patients with abnormal IRT was the concentration
supranormal.  Our data suggest that low IRT concentrations are an
excellent index of diminished pancreatic reserve in CF and that
serum-IRT concentration would be a useful diagnostic test.  The fact
that CF patients at birth invariably have very high IRT
concentrations which fall with age and the progress of the disease,
allied with the fact that heterozygotes have high concentrations,
supports the previous suggestion that an uncontrolled hypersecretion
of zymogen granules is the basic cellular defect in CF.
