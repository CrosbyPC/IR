Usually cardiac affection in cystic fibrosis is secondary to
progressive affection of the lungs (cor pulmonale).  In rare cases,
babies and young children show a primary and severe cardiac affection
caused by myocardial fibrosis.  We could recently observe two of
these cases in our clinic.  The cases are presented and discussed.
In babies and young children cardiac insufficiency  caused by
cardiomyopathy might be the first presenting symptom in CF.
Therefore, in all children with cardiomyopathy of unknown origin, CF
has to be suspected and the sweat test has to be performed.  Rapidly
progressive cardiac insufficiency responding poorly to treatment and
rhythm disturbances are typical.  Correct early diagnosis is
important for early genetic counseling.
