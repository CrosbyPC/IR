Evidence is accumulating which indicates that the basic defect in
cystic fibrosis interferes with the formation of recognition markers
on hydrolytic enzymes. As a result these hydrolases leak into the
extracellular space and some of them display abnormal
thermolabilities. By heat inactivation of plasma alpha-mannosidase at
41 degrees C and plasma phosphatase at 36.5 degrees C, both enzymes
being assayed at pH 5.4, it is possible to differentiate normal
people from cystic fibrosis carriers and patients.
