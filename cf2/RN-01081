Fifty-three patients with cystic fibrosis were treated with large
doses of tobramycin sulphate, 10 mg/kg/24 h.  Patients received an
average of 3.2 courses, each lasting 10 to 14 days.  The patients
were examined with audiometric and vestibular tests, and in one
patient, a 10-year-old girl, we found a transient high tone loss at
8000 Hz bilaterally that might be attributed to the tobramycin
treatment.  All patients had normal kidney function.  High dose
tobramycin treatment in children with normal kidney function gives
minimal clinical risks of adverse ototoxic effects, even after
repeated courses of treatment.
