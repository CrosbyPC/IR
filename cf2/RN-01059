Cultured skin fibroblast and primary amniotic fluid cell alpha-L-
fucosidase had a double optimum of pH 5.0 and 6.0. Alpha-L-fucosidase
was largely bound as a single peak to DEAE-cellulose at pH 6.6.
Sucrose density isoelectric focusing revealed up to seven components
with pI values of 4.9, 5.2, 5.4, 5.8, 6.1, 6.5 and 7.1 with their
apparent KM values (77--500 mumol/l) being higher than that (57
mumol/l) of the unfocused enzyme. Liver, skin fibroblast and amniotic
fluid cell alpha-L-fucosidase was separated into two peaks by gel
filtration. Peak one was more active and stable at low pH and more
thermostable at 50 degrees C than peak two, while both peaks had an
apparent KM of 52 mumol/l. Apart from the different proportions of
the peaks separated by gel filtration, the results for the three
tissues were similar. The properties of alpha-L-fucosidase studied
were similar for control and cystic fibrosis liver or skin
fibroblasts.
