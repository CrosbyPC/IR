Despite the critical role played by a clinical pharmacologist, there
are only three in Canada who specialize in paediatrics.  The role of
paediatric clinical pharmacologists in the promotion of safer and
more effective drug use, in research, in teaching, and in service are
discussed, as well as contributions from clinical pharmacology.
