In 25 children (13 male; 12 female) with cystic fibrosis aged 6
months to 16 years and 24 matched controls total serum vitamin E
levels and fatty acid patterns of serum cholesterol esters,
phospholipids and triglycerides are demonstrated. Compared to
controls (1.02 +/- 0.24 mg/dl) the total serum vitamin E levels are
significantly decreased in patients with cystic fibrosis (0.30 +/-
0.26 mg/dl) (p less than 0.01). There is no significant difference
comparing the fatty acid patterns of the serum ester fractions of
both groups. Differences can be seen best in the cholesterol ester
fraction. In this fraction linoleic acid shows a trend to be
decreased in the cystic fibrosis patients compared to the control
group. A possible influence of height velocity on the levels of
essential fatty acids is discussed.
