Genetic aspects of pediatric lung disease.

LUNG-DISEASES: fg.

ALPHA-1-ANTITRYPSIN: df.  ASTHMA: fg.  CHILD.  CILIA: pa.

Several genetic diseases are described which affect the lung,
usually or at least in some cases, in the pediatric age group.
The four disorders discussed have been selected wither for their
high frequency or for their demonstration of the variety of ways in
which genetic factors can influence disease: cystic fibrosis, one of
the most common of the metabolic disorders inherited as an autosomal
recessive trait; immotile cilia syndrome, including Kartagener's
syndrome, single gene disorders involving structural abnormalities
of the cilia; asthma, a common disorder in children with a genetic
component; and alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, an inherited protein
deficiency commonly causing obstructive lung disease in adults and
occasionally affecting children.
