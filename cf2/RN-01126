An immunoreactive-trypsin assay uses small dried-blood spots
(diameter 1.25 mm) and is therefore suitable for incorporation in
established neonatal screening schemes. Blood specimens from neonates
with cystic fibrosis had trypsin levels greater than those in control
subjects, thus confirming earlier findings. Trypsin levels were below
normal in several older patients with cystic fibrosis.
