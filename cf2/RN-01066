There are certain aspects of the symptomatology of cystic fibrosis
that bear a resemblance to those of essential fatty acid deficiency.
We fed a group of patients essential fatty acids orally since
intravenous administration is not a practical method for long term
treatment.  Results of the study were varied.  Although some response
was noted in all patients, there were no consistent clinical changes
seen in every patient.  The oral EFA therapy effected no change in
sputum cultures.  After one year of EFA, the sweat sodium
concentration was lower in all but one patient.  The clinical aspect
of our study is small, but promising.  The results suggest a role for
EFAs in the care of CF.  Whether EFA is a factor in the etiology of
CF or merely a manifestation of malabsorption requires further
investigation.
