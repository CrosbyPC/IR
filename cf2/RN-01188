Prone immersion physical exercise therapy has been used successfully
in the physical rehabilitation of middle-aged adults with moderate to
severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The purpose of this
pilot project was to evaluate the effects of PIPE therapy in children
with cystic fibrosis. Three children with CF, two boys aged 6 and 14
years and one girl aged 15 years, voluntarily participated in the
experimental training program. The patients performed individualized
group exercise three times a week on alternate days for 28
consecutive weeks at an intensity of approximately 75 percent aerobic
capacity. Duration of exercise gradually increased from 15 (3 x 5
minutes) to 60 (3 x 20 minutes) minutes while the rest period after
each exercise was constant at two minutes. PIPE training resulted in
increased physical work capacity and maximal oxygen consumption in
all three subjects. Curiously, these changes were not accompanied by
training bradycardia.
