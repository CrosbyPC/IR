Recently, Antonowicz et al. proposed a simple test for cystic
fibrosis that could be used to verify the Boehringer-Mannheim
meconium test result and thus reduce the false-positive incidence.
The test is based on the detection of lactase activity in meconium.
The 'lactase test' may be of some value as a confirmatory test when
used with the BM-mec test although its specificity in this study was
not as good as previously reported.
