Our cystic-fibrosis  children usually either have severe lung disease
with mild steatorrhea or severe maldigestion with lesser pulmonary
problems.  We therefore measured serum-proteases in cystic-fibrosis
patients and controls to see if there was any support for the
following hypothesis: since lack of antitrypsin is associated with
lung damage, plasma-trypsin in excess of antitrypsin might be
responsible for the lung damage in cystic fibrosis.  General protease
and trypsin levels were measured spectrophotometrically using a
modification of the method of Erlanger, Kojowsky and Cohen.  Our
result showed no significant difference between protease and trypsin
levels in cystic-fibrosis patients and controls.  The difference
between our results and those of Crossley et al. may be explained by
the differing measuring technique used.  Our trypsin levels were
measured spectrophotometrically and theirs by radioimmunoassay.
