TIME-FACTORS.

Tritiated thymidine (3H-TdR) incorporation into DNA of the
fibroblasts derived from subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF) and
their controls was studied with scintillation counting and
autoradiography.  3H-TdR incorporation at 24 hours postseeding was
significantly less (p < 0.005) in CF strains in comparison with
cells from controls.  The percentage of labeled fibroblasts was not
significantly difference between the two strains (p > 0.1).  The
cell cycle time and the duration of each phase were studied by a
mitotic selection and scintillation counting technique.  There was
no difference in cell cycle time between CF and control fibroblasts,
however, the duration of the synthetic phase was significantly (p <
0.005) longer in CF subjects.
