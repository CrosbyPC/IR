In a study of eight glycosidases in serum samples from 72 cystic
fibrosis patients, 85 cystic fibrosis parents and 34 healthy and
diseased controls, significant elevations of mean alpha-glucosidase
levels were found in cystic fibrosis patients. All other glycosidases
did not show any significant change. Mean alpha-glucosidase levels in
obligate heterozygotes were the same as in control individuals.
Moreover, alpha-glucosidase levels in cystic fibrosis patients
correlated with the degree of clinical impairment as measured by the
Schwachman score.
