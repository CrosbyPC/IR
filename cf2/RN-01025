Patients with cystic fibrosis were immunized with subunit influenza
vaccine and their haemagglutination-inhibiting (HI) antibody
responses were compared with responses in young healthy adults.
There was no significant difference in the antibody levels reached
after immunization and no evidence of any impairment of responses in
the patient group.
