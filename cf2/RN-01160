Recently, one of us suggested a new hypothesis concerning the 'basic
defect' of cystic fibrosis.  The purpose of the present paper is to
review this model and to critically discuss its eventual diagnostic
applications.  With extensive studies, we collected experimental data
which contribute five major arguments in favour of the proposition
that CF may be an enzyme recognition site mutant.  With fibroblast
cultures the three genotypes can be separated in the following way:
CF homozygote, leaky for alkaline phosphatase (A1P) and lysosomal
hydrolases/A1P is Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein (THP) inducible; CF
heterozygote, leaky for A1P and lysosomal hydrolases/A1P is not THP
inducible; normal control, not leaky for A1P and lysosomal
enzymes/A1P is not THP inducible.  With the exception of a second
double-blind study, the THP induction as well as the leakage analysis
seem to be statistically unequivocal: they strongly support our
hypothesis concerning the basic defect in CF.
