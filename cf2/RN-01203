This report presents experimental observations indicating the
presence of an inhibitory activity in cystic fibrosis (CF) serum
which impairs phagocytosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by rabbit as
well as human alveolar macrophages. Of the 49 patient serum samples
studied, 40 consistently showed greater than or equal to 60%
inhibition, 3 showed no inhibition and 6 were in the range of 20-60%
inhibition of Pseudomonas phagocytosis. In parallel studies, the
phagocytosis of S. aureus and S. marcescens was found not to be
inhibited by CF serum. Mixing of CF serum with normal serum could not
overcome the inhibitory effect, indicating the presence of an
inhibitory factor rather than the lack of a necessary component. The
inhibitory activity is not lost upon exposure of serum to glass, upon
freezing the serum once, or upon heating at 56 degrees C for 30
minutes.
