An alternative method for assaying the cystic fibrosis factor could
be on the electrophysiological responses of isolated living tissues.
The ability of the frog's gastric mucosa to secrete hydrochloric acid
and maintain a negative potential difference is well known.  This
potential difference across the secretory (mucosa) to the nutrient
(serosa) side coupled with its property of transporting chloride and
hydrogen ions against an electrochemical gradient could therefore
serve as a useful model for investigating any induced changes in the
presence of CF and non-CF plasma.  From the results obtained the
short circuit current and H+ secretion responses in the presence of
CF (whole) plasma show significant increases compared to the control.
These findings show that in the presence of CF plasma, whole or
plasma fraction B, there is a marked increase in the actively
transported Cl- and H+.  The effect of CF plasma in increasing net
Cl- flux is important considering the elevation of this electrolyte
in the sweat of CF patients and deserved further investigation.
