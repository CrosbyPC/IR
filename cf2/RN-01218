I propose that clinicians should have a general understanding of what
little physiology is known about tocopherol, be able to recognize the
circumstances that cause low tocopherol levels, understand when to
provide physiologic replacement therapy, and accept the
responsibility for protecting their patients from uncontrolled
experimental use of tocopherols.  Tocopherol physiology, tocopherol
pharmacology, tocopherol deficiency, therapy in deficiency states,
and pharmacological doses of tocopherol are discussed.  Patients with
prolonged fat malabsorption and some premature infants receiving iron
must be given vitamin E.  Use of tocopherol therapy in
bronchopulmonary dysplasia and retrolental fibroplasia, while
promising, is unproven and should be used only in a controlled study.
Research on the role of vitamin E in human physiology is entering a
rapid-growth phase.
