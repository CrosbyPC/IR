Metabolic alkalosis in infants with cystic fibrosis [letter].

ALKALOSIS: et.  CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: co.

CARBON-DIOXIDE: bl.  CHLORIDES: an.  CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: di.

I have diagnosed six cystic fibrosis infants under 1 year of age,
four of whom had documented episodes of hypoelectrolytemia and severe
metabolic alkalosis.  These additional data support our previous
hypothesis that chronic sweat electrolyte depletion, more frequently
than previously recognized, can cause severe metabolic derangements
in infants with cystic fibrosis, especially those living in both
humid and dry, hot climates.
