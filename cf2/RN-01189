INFANT.  MALE.

A patient with cystic fibrosis was encountered who presented with
anemia, hypoproteinemia, edema and failure to thrive.  A blood
transfusion resulted in some improvement, but the symptoms recurred
in a few weeks.  Only after the correct diagnosis was made and
appropriate therapy instituted did the patient show signs of
improvement.  The account of this case illustrates the importance of
considering the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in any child with
malnutrition.
