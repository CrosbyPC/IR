A criticism often levelled at the forced expiration technique (FET)
is that it increases and may even produce bronchospasm.  It was our
impression that the use of forced expiration when combined with
periods of relaxed diaphragmatic breathing did not aggravate
bronchospasm and shortened the postural drainage session.  Two groups
of patients were studied: 24 with cystic fibrosis to evaluate the use
of the FET as an independent means of postural drainage; and 20
asthmatic patients to assess the effect of the FET on bronchospasm.
The studies indicate that the forced expiration technique increases
the efficiency of postural drainage, but does not increase airway
obstruction.  This technique can be applied to both medical and
surgical conditions when postural drainage, or a modified form of
postural drainage, is indicated.
