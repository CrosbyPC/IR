In a series of 62 cases of cystic fibrosis presenting at the
Transvaal Memorial Hospital for Children, Johannesburg, during the
10-year period 1968-1978, 15 patients required surgical treatment
for 17 complications of the disease.  Meconium ileus, rectal
prolapse, intussusception and ethmoiditis were the commonest
surgical presentations, and portal hypertension, bronchial
obstruction and nasal polyposis were also experienced.  As the basic
defect is unknown, treatment today is still directed towards these
usually unpredictable secondary consequences.
