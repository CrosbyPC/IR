Following Rao and Nadlers' report of decrease arginine activity in
the blood of patients with cystic fibrosis we have been trying to
apply their findings to the prenatal diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.
We were therefore most interested in the reports on the use of
4-methylumbelliferyl-rho-guanidinobenzoate (MUGB) for assaying
arginine esterase activity in amniotic fluid.  Our results with MUGB
are similar to those of Brock and Haywood but are substantially
higher than those of Walsh and Nedler.  A sample of amniotic fluid
that had been incubated with MUGB and then assayed with
pro-phe-arg-4-methylcoumarinyl-7-amide (PPA-MCA) showed less than 20%
of the activity of a similarly treated control sample that had not
been incubated with MUGB.  The activity of arginine esterase towards
PPA-MCA both in amniotic fluid and in cultures amniotic fluid cells
is much greater than towards CBZ-Arg-AMC.  These levels of activity
are high enough to warrant further investigation for use in an
antenatal diagnosis.
