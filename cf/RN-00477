Our patient had well-compensated and late-appearing cystic fibrosis
manifested by moderately decreased exercise, tolerance and a normal
semen analysis, and he had presumably fathered one child.  It is
important to again emphasize the physician's obligation to determine
fertility in any male cystic fibrosis patient, particularly with
late-onset of symptoms, and to provide appropriate genetic
counseling.
