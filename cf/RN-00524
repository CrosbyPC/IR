Elevated levels of plasma CEA were found in patients with cystic
fibrosis. The elevations were well correlated with the Shwachman
scores of the patients. Parallel changes of the levels of plasma CEA
and clinical conditions of four patients were also observed in the
follow-up studies. Close clinical examination indicated that the
elevated plasma CEA of cystic fibrosis patients may be derived from
sputum which is produced in abnormal amounts. This hypothesis is
further supported by the very high content and the chromatographic
profile of the CEA activity of sputum from patients with cystic
fibrosis.
