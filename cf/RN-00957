Ultrastructural and cytochemical observations indicate that both
cystic fibrosis (CF) sera and calcium ionophore A23187 induce a
swelling or an increase in the size and possibly the number of
secondary lysosomes and an increase in mucus secretion in epithelium
of the rabbit tracheal bioassay system. Extended incubation of the
rabbit tracheal explants with either CF or control sera produces a
cytotoxic effect on the tracheal epithelium, but only after the
termination of the normal bioassay time period. Comparative
ultrastructural study of the effect of both CF sera and calcium
ionophore A23187 on the rabbit tracheal bioassay system indicates
that increased membrane permeability to calcium may be important in
the production of the ciliary dyskinesia response by CF serum
factor(s) in the rabbit tracheal bioassay system.
