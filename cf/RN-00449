Reviewing evidence of abnormal taste acuity elicits several factors
which can change a patient's taste acuity.  Consideration of his
diagnosis, his nutritional status, and the treatment he is receiving
or has received can offer further understanding of his perceptions of
food.  Future studies will furnish more information about how the
patient's ability to taste and smell may be altered and thus affect
his attitude toward food.
