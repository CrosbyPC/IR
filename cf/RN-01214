A roentgenogram scoring system is presented that is useful in the
evaluation and follow-up of patients with cystic fibrosis. The system
has been shown to be reproducible by and between observers and to
correlate significantly with results of pulmonary function tests,
Shwachman-Kulczycki scores, and, in a short-term evaluation,
morbidity.
