Concanavalin A (Con A) binding sites were visualized
ultrastructurally in the cultured fibroblasts from cystic fibrosis
patients, obligatory heterozygotes, and normal individuals by
peroxidase labeling technique. Con A binding sites were localized as
a continuous layer on the external side of the plasma membrane in
fixed fibroblasts of the three genotypes. In living cells, Con A
induces both lateral and vertical movements of binding sites as
expressed by cap formation and internalization of the plasma
membrane. Fibroblasts of the three genotypes responded similarly to
Con A treatment and failed to show significant detectable
differences.
