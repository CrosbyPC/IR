A test meal for assessing the intraluminal phase of absorption in
childhood has been validated. 132 test meals were administered to 110
patients aged 2 weeks to 18 years (mean age 4.3 years). 10 children
with suspected malabsorption, who were proven to be normal after
extensive investigation, constituted the control group. The
activities of pancreatic enzymes, and the total and individual bile
salt concentrations are presented for the control subjects, and
pancreatic enzyme levels in this group are compared with those seen
in children with pancreatic insufficiency (cystic fibrosis). The test
meal has been designed so that it can be administered to children
with suspected gluten, cows' milk, or disaccharide intolerance. The
control data provided a basis for the interpretation of information
obtained from the application of such a test meal to the clinical
investigation of children with suspected malabsorption.
