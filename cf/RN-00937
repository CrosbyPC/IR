Cystic fibrosis is a common and serious disease, and presents a
challenge in management to the paediatrician, nurse, dietitian,
physiotherapist, and all other members of the caring team.  The
outstanding research challenge is to discover the basic defect, and
if this is not treatable to find a method of identifying carriers
and affected infants in utero.  In this task, the work of the Cystic
Fibrosis Research Trust, both in raising money for research and for
supporting and advising patients, is much appreciated.
