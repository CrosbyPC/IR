The Golgi complex has an important role in the regulation and normal
development of the cell, contributing to anabolic functions including
the assembly and secretion of macromolecules and to catabolic
functions, in the synthesis of lysosomes.  The central role of the
Golgi complex in the biosynthesis of glycoproteins has been
demonstrated.  The purpose of this review is to focus attention on
the structural and functional correlation of the Golgi complex in the
liver, in relation to its involvement in disease.  The hepatic
parenchymal cell has been used widely as a model to study
biosynthetic, absorptive and secretory functions of epithelial cell
types.  The studies are grouped under five broad headings: structural
organization; development and differentiation; ultrastructural
changes in pathologic conditions; alterations in glycoprotein
biosynthesis; and alterations in glycosyltransferases.
