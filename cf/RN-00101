This letter is prompted by recent reports of favourable results
after the use of an artificial diet consisting of a protein
hydrolysate, a glucose polymer, and medium-chain glycerides in the
treatment of cystic fibrosis of the pancreas.  It has been our
observation that children often find these preparations unpleasant
and unpalatable.  Loose motions, nausea, and vomiting are quite
common.  I have comparable experience with their use in other
malabsorption states and advanced protein-calorie malnutrition.
Whether the untoward effects result from excessive flooding of gut
and/or exceedingly high blood-amino acid levels is a matter of
speculation.
