According to Schwachman and Holsclaw, a cystic-fibrosis child who
does not present with meconium ileus and who receives optimum care
now has an 80% chance of reaching adulthood.  The main feature
needing continuous medical care in the older CF patient is
persisting, and often progressive, chest disease.  CF patients often
owe their lives to paediatrician and to parents who have persevered
with an arduous and exacting treatment regimen.  Now that such
patients are reaching adult life, we must continue to offer the best
possible support.
