Cystic fibrosis and HLA.

CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: fg.  HLA-ANTIGENS.

ADOLESCENCE.  CHILD.  CHILD-PRESCHOOL.  FEMALE.  GENE-FREQUENCY.
HUMAN.  HLA-ANTIGENS: an.  INFANT.  MALE.  PEDIGREE.

In 94 children suffering from cystic fibrosis, no abnormal
frequencies of HLA markers of the A and B locus were observed in
comparison with the distribution of these antigens in control series.
Furthermore, the HLA genotypes of seven pairs of diseased sibs are
incompatible with the hypothesis of a closed linkage between CF--an
autosomal recessive transmitted disease--and HLA.
