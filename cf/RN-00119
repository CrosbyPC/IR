The water-binding capacity of a protein is minimal at its
isoelectric point (pH 3.5 - 5 for the keratins making up the horny
layers) and increases with increasing divergence from the
isoelectric point.  It is for this reason that normal palmar skin
wrinkles after moderate immersion in warm water, especially if it
is soapy (pH 8 or more).  However, in patients with cystic fibrosis
it is the increased salt content of the sweat rather than the pH
difference which increases the water-binding capacity of the
keratin, and is responsible for the wrinkling in these patients.
