The BM meconium test is a useful screening test for cystic fibrosis.
However, we have had false-positive results in two babies caused by
the use of rectal glycerin suppositories.  The babies presented with
signs suggestive of intestinal obstruction possibly due to meconium
ileus, and glycerin suppositories were inserted to speed the passage
of meconium so that the BM test could be done to help confirm the
diagnosis.  The tests were positive but the babies were subsequently
shown not to have cystic fibrosis, and we found that the glycerin
suppositories themselves produce the typical blue colour on the test
strip.
