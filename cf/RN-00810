A pilot study has examined the effect of cimetidine on steatorrhea in
children with pancreatic insufficiency due to CF who were receiving
pancreatic supplements.  Administration of cimetidine with pancreatic
supplements reduced the faecal fat excretion in 4 out of 5 children,
in 3 cases by more than 50%.  In Case 4 steatorrhea increased on
cimetidine but without any symptoms and we have no explanation for
it.  None of the children had any side effects from the drug.
Further studies are needed to determine the indications of cimetidine
in the dietary management of CF.
