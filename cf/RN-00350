Clinico-pathological evaluation of 37 cases of cystic fibrosis of
the pancreas in infancy at necropsy.

CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: pa.

AUTOPSY.  FEMALE.  HUMAN.  INFANT.  MALE.

The clinical and morphological findings of 37 cases of cystic
fibrosis of the pancreas from 525 full, but non-consecutive
necropsies are presented.  All of these 37 cases were diagnosed at
post-mortem examination.  The autopsy incidence was 7% and none of
the cases was beyond two years of age.  Morphological findings
revealed varying severities in organ involvement in all cases, with
absence of fibrosis of the pancreas in some.  In only two cases
histopathological changes seemed to be confined to the pancreas.
This study suggests that cystic fibrosis plays a considerable role in
infant deaths in our country and in most if not all cases the
diagnosis must necessarily be based on postmortem studies.
