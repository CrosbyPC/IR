The combination of chronic pulmonary sepsis and pancreatic
insufficiency in children with cystic fibrosis may lead to
malnutrition.  We describe our experience of the long-term use of
continuous nocturnal infusion of elemental diet in a patient with
cystic fibrosis.  Our patient tolerated the long-term nocturnal
elemental diet well, and it enabled her to continue normal
everyday activity and eat normal meals.  The periods of nutritional
support coincided with periods of increased body weight and total
body potassium, indicating that the lean body mass was increased.
We think that these results show a need for further studies of home
treatment in children with cystic fibrosis.
