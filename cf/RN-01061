Heterozygote advantage in cystic fibrosis: mosquito tests.

CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: fg.  INSECT-BITES-AND-STINGS.  MOSQUITOES.

HETEROZYGOTE.  HUMAN.  MALARIA: mo, oc.

Tests to demonstrate a preference by mosquitoes for stinging controls
as opposed to obligate heterozygotes for Cystic Fibrosis proved
negative. If a heterozygote advantage caused a lower malarial
incidence in carriers in South West Africa, it must have worked
through the malarial parasite being adversely affected by a serum
factor. This remains to be tested.
