The varied morphologic lesions in cystic fibrosis each result from
obstruction of one type or another, documented or presumed.  They are
modified by the age of the individual, the severity and the
conditions peculiar to each tissue.  These lesions, plus the
functional changes in sweat electrolytes, membrane transport and
serum factor affecting syncrony of cilia, represent the diverse
actions of a genetic defect, the intermediate stages of which are as
yet unknown.  Neither the diversity of abnormalities, their range in
severity, nor differences in the age of onset argue convincingly for
a trigger mechanism or acquire rather than inborn deficiency.
