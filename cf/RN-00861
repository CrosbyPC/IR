Intestinal mucins are complex glycoproteins which are secreted from
goblet cells, and form a gel-like covering over the mucosal surface.
They are assumed to provide lubrication and protection of the
underlying epithelium against potentially injurious chemicals,
enzymes, bacteria and dietary constituents. Recent advances in our
understanding of mucin structure, secretion and functional properties
are reviewed in this paper. Implications for diseases such as cystic
fibrosis, peptic ulcer, malignancy and inflammatory bowel disease are
briefly discussed.
