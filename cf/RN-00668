Lymphocyte responses to the mitogens phytohemagglutinin and
concanavalin A and to Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus,
Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were evaluated in
patients with cystic fibrosis and in normal individuals. Lymphocyte
proliferation in vitro was stimulated by gentamicin-killed whole
bacteria, and the proliferative response was measured by
[3H]thymidine incorporation. The in vitro lymphocyte responses to
antibiotic-killed bacterial reached maximum thymidine incorporation
after 5 days in culture and followed a unimodal dose-response curve
for each of the bacteria studied. A significant specific incapacity
to respond to P. aeruginosa was detected in cystic fibrosis patients
with advanced clinical disease.
