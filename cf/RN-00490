The clinical abnormalities in cystic fibrosis can be categorized into
three headings: pulmonary disease, digestive disorders, and ion
transport abnormalities.  Research directions in cystic fibrosis have
evolved from observations of the characteristic malfunctions inherent
in the disease.  These include defects in mucociliary function,
mucous secretion, membrane transport and glycoprotein biosynthesis.
Drawing from what is known about the bases of other inherited
diseases, one could predict that cystic fibrosis results from an
abnormal functional protein, as in sickle cell anemia; an enzyme
deficiency, as in phenylketonuria; or a deficiency of a normal
inhibitor, as in hereditary angioedema.
