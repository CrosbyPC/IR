In II polyps from patients with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas, the
density, shape, and architecture of mucous glands were studied by the
whole-mount method and compared with 102 non-cystic-fibrosis polyps.
There were no differences in density which was in most polyps less
than 0.5 gland/mm.2. The shape and architecture as well as other
histological appearances of the polyp were also alike in both groups
of polyps which could not be distinguished. The pathogenesis of nasal
polyps in cystic fibrosis is discussed. Apparently, it is the same as
that of non-cystic-fibrosis polyps.
