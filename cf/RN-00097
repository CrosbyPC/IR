Infants with cystic fibrosis occasionally may present with a symptom
complex of anemia, hypoproteinemia, and edema.  Case reports of
seven infants between the ages of 1 to 4 months who developed these
abnormalities indicate that in several instances the children's
condition was misdiagnosed as milk-sensitivity or milk-allergy.
Furthermore, their case histories verify that their hypoalbuminemia
and anemia is nutritional and is corrected when a readily absorbed
diet with pancreatic-enzyme supplement is given.  A retrospective
review of feeding histories of 100 infants with cystic fibrosis, as
well as these case reports, indicate that affected children who are
breast-fed or fed with soy-based formulas are more likely to develop
the syndrome.
