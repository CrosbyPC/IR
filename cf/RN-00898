In the February, 1977, issue of The Journal, Dr. Heffer comments on
publications concerning the occurrence of cystic fibrosis (CF) in
black children.  He "feels" that CF occurs more frequently than we
have reported.  Our ten-year search in the Washington, D.C., area
shows a minimum incidence of cystic fibrosis among black newborn
infants as one per 17,000.  Since 1972, we have identified an
additional four black patients with cystic fibrosis in black
children.  This is consistent with the previously reported incidence
of one in 17,000.  Therefore, we disagree with Heffer, that this is a
common disease among blacks.
