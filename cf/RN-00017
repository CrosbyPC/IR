SPIROMETRY.

Cystic fibrosis is no longer rare in adults.  The lung is the main
target organ and the basic lesion is bronchial obstruction leading to
bronchiectasis.  Interstitial infiltrates and cyst-like changes are
characteristic on roentgenography.  Complications include pulmonary
hypertension, pneumonitis, hemorrhage, and pneumothorax.  Little
correlation exists between respiratory tract and pancreatic and
gastrointestinal involvement, despite similarities in pathogenesis.
Pulmonary cystic fibrosis in adults does not always resemble the
condition in children, and must be differentiated from other chronic
interstitial diseases.
