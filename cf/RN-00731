Acute and chronic respiratory disorders play a large role in the
practitioner's daily care of infants, children, and adolescents.  To
assist with the more sophisticated problems in these diseases, the
Ohio Committee on Pulmonary Standards has established pediatric
pulmonary care centers distributed over the State of Ohio.  Referral
to these centers may be requested by the practicing physician.  To
illustrate the validity of this concept, this article reviews the
care given to patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), the improved
prognosis for this disease entity, and the advantages of expertise
and of centralized care.
