Four patients who suffered from cystic fibrosis and late-onset bowel
obstruction (meconium ileus equivalent), and who were treated by
surgery, are discussed. The importance of early correct diagnosis is
stressed, since surgery may be prevented if bowel washouts and oral
medications are given before the condition becomes complicated.
