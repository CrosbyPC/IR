In an infant with galactosemia high levels of galactose-1-phosphate
in red blood cells and of blood galactose were observed under a
"galactose-free'' diet. The child did not thrive and developed a
liver cirrhosis. At the age of 5 months he died unexpectedly. Post
mortem examination revealed in the pancreas and the small intestine
changes suggestive of a cystic fibrosis. Since the exogenous
administration of galactose by diet could be excluded the endogenous
production of significant amounts of galactose-1-phosphate has to be
considered.
