The effects of acute diuresis in patients with cor pulmonale
secondary to cystic fibrosis were studied. Both hemodynamic
parameters and arterial blood gas changes were investigated. The
major effect noted was a significant reduction of systemic venous
pressure. Pulmonary artery and pulmonary artery wedge pressure either
remained constant or declined slightly. No consistent changes were
noted in cardiac output or arterial blood gases. Acute diuresis of
moderate degree appears to be a safe and effective manner in which to
treat the systemic venous congestion of cor pulmonale in this
situation.
