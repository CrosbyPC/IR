FEMALE.  GENE-FREQUENCY.  HUMAN.  HLA-ANTIGENS: an.  INFANT.  MALE.
CELIAC-DISEASE: im.

Thirty-three patients with Cystic Fibrosis were HLA typed.  Relative
risk values and phenotype frequencies were calculated.  No
statistically significant differences in the HLA antigen
distribution were found among the patients with Cystic Fibrosis.
