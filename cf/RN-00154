This paper analyzes the cell cycle of cystic fibrosis-derived
fibroblasts and statistically demonstrates their failure to support a
normal population doubling time in vitro and indicates that this is
due largely to a failure of the cystic fibrosis-derived cells to
enter the cell cycle in normal numbers.  We have no explanation for
the significant difference in the behavior of these cells from
patients with cystic fibrosis vis-a-vis either normal or disease
control fibroblasts, save to conclude that it proceeds from an
intrinsic property of the cells themselves.
