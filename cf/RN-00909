Two newborns with intestinal obstruction of the terminal ileum
without mucoviscidosis were cured by Gastrografin enema. A further
case of a premature infant showed, at autopsy, a large intestine
containing normal meconium, but an ileum which was plugged with
tenacious meconium containing PAS-positive and alcian blue-negative
mucus. Our 3 cases were similar to cases of "meconium disease"
reported by Rickham and of "meconium plug in the small intestine"
reported by Emery. The primary cause of this disease lies in the
large amount of PAS-positive mucus secreted from goblet cells of the
ileal mucosa and the hypertrophy of lymph nodules in the ileal
submucosa.
