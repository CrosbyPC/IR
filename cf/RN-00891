Studies on the basic defect in cystic fibrosis: the kinin hypothesis.

It is our hypothesis that in cystic fibrosis there is a genetically
determined specific deficiency in the activity of either the
glandular kallikrein or in its activating enzyme, and that this
defect is the primary defect in the disease.  The immediate
consequence of either of these defects is the absence of kallidin and
the resulting failure of reabsorption.  The fact that there may be
mutations affecting distinct enzymes could account for the genetic
heterogeneity of cystic fibrosis.  A consequence of a defective
kallikrein system would be accumulation of a precursor related to the
low molecular weight kininogen and we propose that this compound is
the ciliary-dyskinesia factor.
