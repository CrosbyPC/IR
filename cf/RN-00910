My colleagues and I reviewed the diagnosis, management, and prognosis
in 17 cases of infants with cystic fibrosis and severe respiratory
distress who were admitted to the Children's Hospital Medical Center,
Boston, between 1968 and 1972.  There was a 60% mortality overall.
Six of the 17 infants were treated with assisted ventilation, of whom
only one survived.  Our subsequent experience with assisted
ventilation has shown no improvement in the survival of these
infants.
