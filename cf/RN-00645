A group of 102 obligate heterozygotes for the cystic fibrosis gene
were examined for genetic type of pancreatic isoamylases as well as
enzyme activity of pancreatic iso-amylases, salivary isoamylases and
total amylase in serum. The analysis was performed using
electrophoretic separation for detection of the various types of
isoamylases, and their relative activity was determined by means of
densitometry. The activities of salivary isoamylases and total
amylase in serum showed no significant differences between the cystic
fibrosis heterozygotes and a control group. The frequency of the
variant gene for pancreatic isoamylase was also the same as in the
controls. The mean value for pancreatic isoamylase was slightly
higher in the cystic fibrosis heterozygotes than in the control group
(0.05 greater than P greater than 0.02).
