Edema as the presenting symptom of cystic fibrosis: difficulties in
diagnosis.

HYPOPROTEINEMIA: et.  INFANT.  MALE.  SWEAT: an.

Hypoproteinemia and edema may develop in infants with cystic fibrosis
whatever their diet although prior ingestion of soy bean formula
appears to be a predisposing factor, and a negative sweat chloride
test may be present in a CF child during the hypoproteinemic phase of
the illness.  The diagnosis cannot be excluded until a negative test
with adequate secretion of sweat is obtained after edema and
hypoproteinemia have resolved.
