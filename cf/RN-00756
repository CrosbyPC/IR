Cystic fibrosis of the pancreas is a recessively inherited disorder
generally considered to result in chronic pulmonary or digestive
symptoms.  Therefore, it may not be readily appreciated that this
disease can also present with anemia, edema, and hypoproteinemia,
especially in infants taking breast milk or soy-based formulas.  The
following example involving monozygotic twins given cow's milk
formula since birth will serve to illustrate this association.
