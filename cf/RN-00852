A new method which uses a differential inhibitor to measure
pancreatic and salivary type alpha-amylases (EC 3.2.1.1) was applied
to serum samples from 46 cystic fibrosis (CF) patients (age range 4-
14 years) and 50 controls of the same age group. The levels of
pancreatic type amylase were lower in the CF patients (median 26.5
I.U./1) than the controls (median 81.5) (P less than 0.001). The
results for salivary-type enzyme, however, did not support the
previously reported finding of higher than usual levels in CF
patients. This discrepancy is probably due to differences in
analytical methods. It is felt that this procedure will be of value
in the investigation of patients for cystic fibrosis and other
pancreatic disorders.
