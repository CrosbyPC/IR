A cross-over trial of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy has
been conducted on 12 children with cystic fibrosis using Pancrex V
forte and Nutrizym tablets in equivalent dosage.  No differences
were found in the effectiveness of these products as measured by
stool volume, number of bowel actions, faecal fat excretion, and
urine urea excretion.  Neither product eliminated the steatorrhoea.
Though there was no laboratory evidence to support their choice nine
patients expressed a preference for Nutrizym at the conclusion of
the trial.  This preference was based partly on the smaller number
of tablets which are required.
