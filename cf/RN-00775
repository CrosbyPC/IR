Six patients with meconium ileus, in whom bowel resection and end-to-
end anastomosis were performed, are presented. Meconium ileus may be
simple or complicated. The simple form may be treated by Gastrografin
enema. Surgery is indicated if conservative treatment fails and for
patients with a complicated obstruction. Provided the bowel is
disobstructed and carefully resected, end-to-end anastomosis is
preferable. Confirmation of the diagnosis by careful histological
examination of the resected bowel is urged.
