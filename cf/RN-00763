The diagnosis of cystic fibrosis is usually established by the
presence of chronic obstructive lung disease and/or gastrointestinal
compromise, together with elevated sweat electrolytes or pathologic
changes in tissue. Because of its highly variable genetic penetrance,
the disease is characterized by varying degrees of involvement of
different exocrine systems.
