The combined use of special cell culture techniques and biochemical
ultramicromethods permits one to handle very small amounts of
materials, to reduce the costs of chemicals, and more accurately to
assess gene dosage effects by expressing enzyme activities per cell
instead of per total cell protein. An alkaline phosphatase induction
test has been developed which allows one to screen small numbers of
fibroblasts for lysosomal storage diseases, cystic fibrosis, and
chromosomal disorders. A successful attempt has been made to automate
the microtechniques. Combining the alkaline phosphatase induction
with the ultramicro automatization should eventually permit one to
screen all pregnancies for major possible fetal genetic defects.
Automated ultramicro enzyme assays should contribute to the general
development of clinical chemistry.
