A simple method for the determination of the activity of trypsin and
chymotrypsin in stool and duodenal aspirations is described.  The
method is based on that described by Barbero et al. (Am. J. Dis.
Child., 112 (1966) 536) [1] but utilizes the time for a drop of 0.1
pH unit in the solution, instead of a constant pH titration, to
determine enzyme activity.  Results for a number of cystic fibrosis
patients and normals compare favorably with the literature.
