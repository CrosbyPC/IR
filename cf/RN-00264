The search for relevant cell culture research in cystic fibrosis:
one researcher's opinion.

CELLS-CULTURED.  CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: pa.  RESEARCH.

CELL-LINE.  CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: fg.  HUMAN.

Recently there has been a plethora of research approaches using cell
culture to study cystic fibrosis.  Although these efforts can be
lauded as attempts to understand one of the most common genetic
disorders affecting the Caucasian population, such research should be
relevant to the clinical entity known as cystic fibrosis.  The
ultimate objectives of this research should be to determine the, as
yet unknown, basic defect and to develop an assay for heterozygote
detection.
