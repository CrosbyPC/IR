The endoscopic pancreaticographic findings in 46 proved cases of
pancreatitis are analyzed.  Pathologic ductograms were demonstrated
in approximately 60%.  Significant information was obtained in many
cases, allowing both proper diagnosis of the primary disease process
and complications thereof.  Because of the latter, the procedure has
proved to be quite helpful in isolating those patients who could
benefit from surgery.
