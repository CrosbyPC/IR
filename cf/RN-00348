The hearts and lungs of 36 patients dying of cystic fibrosis have
been studied to establish the relationship between right ventricular
hypertrophy (RVH), pathological changes in the pulmonary circulation,
and the clinical features. The presence and degree of RVH were
measured by Fulton's technique of weighing the ventricles separately.
Of the subjects who died after the age of 3 years, one in six had no
RVH, although the mean age of this group was not significantly
different from that of the remainder. There was no correlation
between duration of cyanosis, haemoglobin levels, and RVH. Although
not statistically significant, the cases without RVH tended to have
had clubbing of the finger-nails for longer periods before death. The
electrocardiogram was useful in the diagnosis of RVH. Right
ventricular hypertrophy was common in children with lungs of large
volume as judged by the radiographic centile of lung length. Cases
with RVH show reduced background haze in the arteriogram and fewer
arteries per unit area of lung. For the first time thickening of the
medial muscle layer proportional to the degree of RVH has been
demonstrated, only in the smaller arteries. Arterial subintimal
fibrosis is more common in cases with RVH, as is thickening of the
walls of small pulmonary veins. The implications of these findings
are discussed.
