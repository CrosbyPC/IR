Screening an apparently healthy population for metabolic disorders
raises many ethical problems.  It is necessary to differentiate
clearly between screening programmes of a service nature and those
which are really research projects.  Screening for phenylketonuria,
histidinaemia, galactosaemia, cystic fibrosis, Tay-and Sachs disease
are discussed.  These disorders demonstrate some of the advantages
and undoubtedly difficult problems which screening presents.  It is
essential that no one should lose sight of the fact that the aim of
screening is to help the individual and the community.  The
psychological aspects of screening are very important and continuing
thought must be given to the fact that biochemical abnormalities do
not necessarily equate with disease.
