A variety of bioassays have identified molecules circulating in
cystic fibrosis genotypes and synthesized in vitro by cultured cells
from these genotypes by functional disturbances observed in the
assays employed.  Preliminary characterizations of these factors are
in general agreement and the properties include a small molecular
weight polypeptide within the range of 4000 to 10000 MW, a
heat-labile protein having a cationic charge, and a protein present
in saliva, serum, urine (and perhaps sweat) which is synthesized in
vitro by fibroblasts, short-term lymphocytes and long-term lymphoid
lines.  The relationship of the factor or factors to the pathogenesis
of cystic fibrosis is presently unknown, but its presence in cystic
fibrosis genotypes appears to be related to the basic defect.
