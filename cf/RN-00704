Cystic fibrosis in Iraqi children.

CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: oc.

CHILD-PRESCHOOL.  FEMALE.  HUMAN.  INFANT.  IRAQ.  MALE.

Cystic fibrosis (C.F.) was firmly established as a single disease by
Anderson in 1938 although previously case reports had appeared in
the European literature.  Subsequently C.F. has been described in
many parts of the world.  This is the first report of cystic
fibrosis in Arab-Iraqi children.  Seventeen cases of cystic fibrosis
were diagnosed at Medical City Teaching College Hospital, University
of Baghdad, between 1970 and 1976.  In this study the sex-ratio was
2:1.  This compared with the roughly equal ratio usually quoted.  A
possible explanation for this discrepancy is the preference given to
boys in Iraqi families and medical attention is more likely to be
sought on their behalf.
