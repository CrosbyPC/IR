Although complex models involving multiple loci may be plausible, the
high frequency of cystic fibrosis in Caucasians is probably best
explained by selective advantage for the heterozygote carrier.  In
short, an analogy of cystic fibrosis with hemoglobin S sickle cell
anemia may be greater than with Tay-Sachs disease in terms of
molecular mechanisms.  Protein and polypeptide differences have been
reported for the humoral fluids of cystic fibrosis patients and their
heterozygotic relatives in connected with selected bioassay systems.
These directions relate to a model here proposed for the intermediate
stages of the physiology of cystic fibrosis, which builds on a large
body of elegant experimental work.  The basic tenet is that the cells
of cystic fibrosis heterozygotes and normal individuals are in a
stimulatory loop.  Chronic reserpine treatment exaggerates in the
normal rat a loop similar to the one exaggerated by genetic
differences in the human, elevating to pathological levels an
otherwise normal process.
