It is now possible to screen for the presence of the carrier state of
a number of inherited diseases. Such screening can alert one to the
need for antenatal diagnosis where feasible, it can ensure that early
treatment is given to affected infants, and it can assist carriers in
reaching a decision about having children. Facilities for certain
types of screening already exist in some centres in South Africa, and
new techniques will be introduced in the future.
