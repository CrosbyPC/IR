Orchitis and cystic fibrosis [letter].

CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: co.  EPIDIDYMITIS: co.  ORCHITIS: co.

ADOLESCENCE.  CASE-REPORT.  HUMAN.  MALE.

I wish to report the case of J. J., a 17-1/2-year-old white boy known
to have cystic fibrosis since early infancy, who developed an acute
left orchitis and epididymitis in May 1975.  In my review of the past
literature and in my current readings, I have been unable to find any
reported cases of acute orchitis and/or epididymitis in a patient
with cystic fibrosis.  I offer this case as reported and invite
comments.
