Abnormality of mucus secretion, either biochemical or physical, has
long been claimed to be the primary cause of pulmonary complications
- obstruction and infection - in patients suffering from cystic
fibrosis  (CF).  This review will draw in large measure on the
experience of Prof. L. Reid and her research team who over the last
15 years have studied mucus-secreting structures and their
secretions in the normal and diseased lung from various angles:
development, structure and ultrastructure, histochemistry organ
culture, biochemical analysis and rheological characterization.
