Intermittent epigastric pain, partially relieved by food, was the
reason for examining the upper gastrointestinal tract in a
30-year-old man.  The second portion of the duodenum was strikingly
abnormal.  The patient had a history of daily, multiple loose stools
since birth.  At age 12 a diagnosis of small bowel malabsorption due
to fibrocystic disease of the pancreas was established.  In view of
this history, the duodenal changes were considered to be a
manifestation of fibrocystic disease of the pancreas.  At the present
time the cause of these duodenal abnormalities is unknown.
