We report the frequent presence of hyperuricemia in a group of
children with cystic fibrosis who were known to be consuming large
dosages of pancreatic extract as part of their therapy.
Hyperuricemia was more common in older patients who had been treated
for a longer period of time.  Clarification of the role of renal
function and other factors in the production of hyperuricemia awaits
a careful study of the relationship of purine load to urate excretion
at various ages in these patients.
