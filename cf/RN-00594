In 84 consecutive patients with cystic fibrosis, oral
cholecystography was abnormal in 39 (46.4%). The incidence of
abnormal cholecystograms increased with patient age. The 26 patients
with a nonvisualized gallbladder following double-dosage oral
cholecystography were evaluated with intravenous cholangiography; 19
(70.3%) of these were abnormal. Ten patients were found to have
calculi, an incidence of 11.9%. Awareness of the high incidence of
cholecystographic abnormalities and calculi should be helpful in the
evaluation of patients with cystic fibrosis, particularly since
symptoms of abdominal pain are frequent in such patients and may lead
to radiographic investigations.
