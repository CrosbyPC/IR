Professor R. K. Chandra and others found raised serum levels of
alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in a heterozygote carrier of the gene for
cystic fibrosis and in patients with the disease and some of the
siblings.  Our results do not show any significant difference in AFP
levels in patients, siblings, parents, or control children.
Probably the discrepancy in the findings will be explained by more
detailed examination of the technique used.
