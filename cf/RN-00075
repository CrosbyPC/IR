Forty-six deciduous teeth from 17 children with cystic fibrosis who
had a recorded history of tetracycline therapy were sectioned
vertically and horizontally.  Teeth in three representative
staining categories (mild, moderate, and severe) were photographed
under visible and ultraviolet illumination to determine the extent
of tetracycline incorporation into tooth enamel and dentin.
Tetracycline incorporation into enamel was minimal or nonexistent,
whereas tetracycline incorporation into dentin was always observed.
The severity of general surface discoloration was directly related
to the proximity of the tetracycline incorporation to the
dentinoenamel junction.  This was dependent on dosage, duration, and
period of initiation of tetracycline therapy as it related to
odontogenesis.  Critical periods to avoid tetracycline therapy and
thereby to minimize potential tooth discoloration were determined.
