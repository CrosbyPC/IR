This paper describes investigations on the absorption of
3-methoxyphenyl-L-alanine (anisylalanine) in normal subjects,
children with cystic fibrosis and in one child with Hartnup disease.
Anisylalanine was slowly metabolised mainly to acetyl anisylalanine,
and p-methoxyphenyl-pyruvic acid and lactic acids which were
excreted.  In normal adult subjects anisylalanine (25 mg/kg body
weight) was rapidly absorbed, maximum plasma concentrations being
obtained 0.5-1.0 hour after ingestion.  Thereafter the plasma
concentration declined exponentially.  In the group of eight
children with cystic fibrosis, the maximum plasma concentration
was lower than observed in the control group, and was delayed.  A
very poor response was observed in an infant with Hartnup disorder.
