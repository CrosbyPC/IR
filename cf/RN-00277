CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: di.  HETEROZYGOTE.  HUMAN.  METHODS.

During the past year, we have developed a new assay for cystic
fibrosis by utilising the Ussing chamber technique and measuring the
electrical properties of rat jejunum in the presence of the sera to
be tested.  The potential difference (P.D.) and resistance (R.) are
measured with a sensitive electrometer at 5-minute intervals over 60
minutes.  We were able to detect 90% of the heterozygotes.  The
possibility of detecting the remaining 10% is present, and can, we
feel, be achieved by using a more concentrated specimen.
