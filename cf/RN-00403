The recent commercial introduction of a method for detecting albumin
in meconium makes screening for cystic fibrosis feasible for many
hospitals. If the tests is adopted, confirmatory tests should be
available. Quantitative analyses of sweat for sodium by flame
photometry and for chloride by silver titration and ion-sleective
electrodes are now used as confirmatory tests. We compare results of
these confirmatory methods applied to presons with cystic fibrosis,
respiratory disorders, or digestive disorders, and to control
subjects.
