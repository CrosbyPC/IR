The authors report 2 radiographic findings that have not previously
been described in patients with cystic fibrosis: (1) the linear form
of pneumatosis coli (2) large pancreatic concretions which resembled
the pancreatic calcificaitons of hereditary pancreatitis. The patient
with pancreatic calcification also had labile diabetes and episodes
of ketoacidosis, unusual complications of cystic fibrosis.
