HL-A antigens in cystic fibrosis.

ABO-BLOOD-GROUP-SYSTEM: an.  ADOLESCENCE.  BLOOD-GROUPS.  CHILD.

HL-A frequencies of 28 patients with cystic fibrosis and of 240
unrelated controls were compared.  No statistically significant
difference of HL-A frequencies could be observed for both groups.  A
slightly increased HL-A 2 frequency is considered a chance
phenomenon.  In accordance with a previously demonstrated lacking
association of the ABH blood group substances no correlation with
certain HL-A antigens was demonstrable.
