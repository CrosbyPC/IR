I have found that cystic fibrosis (C.F.), which is very common in
South West Africa, occurs almost exclusively in white Afrikaners,
probably as a result of inbreeding, the drift from the Northern Cape
Colony, and religious and geographical separation.  However, I have
not found C.F. in the descendants of the Angola Boers, a small
proportion (6 - 7%) of the White population who belong to a small
branch of the Dutch Reformed Church.  The absence of C.F. may stem
from their limited numbers (7000) but I suggest that it may have at
least partially a genetic basis.  Homozygotes with C.F. are subject
to salt-losing crises which can be fatal in hot weather and
heterozygotes often have an increased concentration of sodium and
chlorine ions in their sweat.  The influence of environmental
temperature and drought may explain why C.F. occurs among Blacks in
temperate zones of the United States but not in Africa, and is less
frequent in the hot southern regions of Europe than in the colder,
more northern areas.  Negative selection of this type may have
operated only in hot, arid environments and the possibility that
other environments offered advantages to C.F. heterozygotes cannot be
excluded.
