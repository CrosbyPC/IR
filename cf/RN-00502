If we are to fully understand the factors which control mucociliary
clearance throughout the human lung and the interrelationships
between clearance and disease, it will be necessary to measure
mucociliary clearance rates in airways at all levels within the lung.
During the past few years, technical means have been sought whereby
the rates of mucus clearance within individual airways can be
measured.  In this laboratory, we have developed a relatively
noninvasive technique for measuring mucociliary tracheal transport
rates.  We measured MTTRs in 20 patients with cystic fibrosis.  The
MTTRs did not correlate well with the degree of pulmonary disease in
these patients.  The measurements of MTTR would suggest that a
deranged mucociliary clearance mechanism is not a necessary condition
for patients with CF.  We have also been interested in evaluating the
effectiveness of the therapy used in the treatment of CF.
