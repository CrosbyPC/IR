We have obtained additional data which support the specificity of the
reported serum glutathione reductase (GR) changes in cystic fibrosis
(CF).  As in previous series, mean GR in CF was 20% greater than in
controls (P < 0.005).  No difference was found between CF and
controls for either lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or glutamic-pyruvic
transaminase (GPT).  It appears that some underlying process or
processes such as leakage into serum from cellular damage as
reflected in raised LDH and GPT might lead to raised GR as
demonstrated by positive correlations in controls.  The absence of a
positive correlation between these enzymes and GR in the CF sample as
well as normal values for LDH and GPT in CF suggests that the raised
serum GR in CF is not attributable to tissue leakage from damaged
cells secondary to the disease.
