The majority (86.6%) of patients with cystic fibrosis were found to
be carriers of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. None of them, however, carried
P. aeruginosa in their nares. In contrast, none of the non-CF family
members of the patients with CF were carriers of P. aeruginosa. For
example, only 4 of 468 cultures from skin, throat, and nares of the
family members were positive for P. aeruginosa. Isolations of P.
aeruginosa from the same CF patients were often of the same pyocine
type. No specific pyocine type of P. aeruginosa was predominant in
patients with CF. Isolations of P. aeruginosa from siblings with CF
may or may not be of the same pyocine type as that of the family
proband. Colonization of a patient with CF by P. aeruginosa is not a
threat to the non-CF members of the family.
