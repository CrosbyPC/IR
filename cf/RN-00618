Contamination of a powdered preparation of pancreatin with Salmonella
schwarzengrund and S. eimsbuettel resulted in the infection of at
least 31% of one group of paediatric patients with cystic fibrosis.
The pancreatin contained very small numbers of Salmonellae, the
infecting dose in at least one child being less than 44 organisms.
More stringent bacteriological standards are needed for
pharmaceuticals and foods used by paediatric patients.
