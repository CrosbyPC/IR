Dr. Conover and his colleagues reported no difference in the
haemolytic activity of serum complement components C1-C9 of cystic
fibrosis (C.F.) patients, obligate heterozygotes, and normal
controls.  They also measured individual complement components by
radial immunodiffusion and found a significant rise of C3 but no
significant difference in C5 levels between these groups.  Using
immunodiffusion kits from the same manufacturer and freshly
obtained sera, we have observed quite different findings.  C5 was
mildly elevated in 20 and more highly elevated in 25 of 56 C.F.
patients, 2 to 29 years of age.  C5 was also elevated in 24 of 51
parents of C.F. patients, 15 showing mild and 9 higher elevations,
while 4 of 24 controls showed only mild elevation.  No correlation
was observed between serum-C5 levels, and the age, sex, clinical
severity of disease (judged by Shwachman-Kulczyki scores), sputum
bacterial colonisation, and mode of treatment of the C.F. patients.
The elevation of C3 and C5 in a majority of patients with C.F. and
obligate heterozygotes is very interesting and is suggestive of
certain genetic defect(s) in the complement activation system in
this autosomal recessive disorder.
