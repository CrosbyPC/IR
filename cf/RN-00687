With improved therapy and recognition of patients with mild disease,
an increasing number of children with cystic fibrosis are reaching
the reproductive years.  Although virtually all males with cystic
fibrosis are sterile, an unknown percentage of females with cystic
fibrosis will be fertile.  We know of only one case in which a
mother with cystic fibrosis produced a child with the same disease.
The purpose of this communication is to report the birth of a child
with cystic fibrosis whose mother also has the disease.
