6 patients with proven cystic fibrosis and a wide variety of
Schwachman clinical scores were studied and the controls were 10
healthy children undergoing minor elective surgical procedures.  The
results show that for children with cystic fibrosis there are not
only decreased proportions of essential fatty acids but that 20:3
omega-9 is found in all cases.  Our results suggest that there is no
intrinsic defect of the desaturating system in cystic fibrosis and
that the pattern of essential-fatty-acid deficiency is entirely
similar to that found in dietary deficiency of essential fatty
acids.  A further significant finding is the occurance if 20:3
omega-9 in apparently healthy children, particularly the very young.
This is probably diet-related and emphasises the young child's very
large requirement for essential fatty acids for membrane synthesis.
The need for adequate polyunsaturated fatty acids in childhood
cannot be overstated, whether they be for normal membrane synthesis
or lowering of serum-lipids, giving possible protection against
cardiovascular disease.
