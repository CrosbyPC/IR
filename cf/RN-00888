Cystic fibrosis is detected with increasing frequency in older
children, adolescents, and even young adults. The quality of life and
longevity in patients with cystic fibrosis is more favorable the
earlier a diagnosis is made and a therapeutic regimen begun. This
report presents and reviews five cases in chich the diagnosis of
cystic fibrosis was made after the age of six years. Emphasis is
placed on the variability of presenting signs and symptoms and the
problems that can arise in confirming a suspected diagnosis of cystic
fibrosis.
