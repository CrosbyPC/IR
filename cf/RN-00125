Using the technique of 3H-ouabain binding to isolate cells Quissell
and Pitot concluded that the Na+-K+ ATPase functions normally in
fibroblasts from cystic fibrosis patients.  However this finding
may not be very relevant to the Na+ transport defect occurring in
this genetic disease.  The Na+ transport abnormality in cystic
fibrosis seems to be confined to exocrine glands.  It is unknown at
present whether the defect resides in an active or passive
transport step of the cation.  At least with isolated sweat gland
tissue and erythrocytes from cystic fibrosis patients, Na+-K+
ATPase activity has been found to be normal.  However a decrease in
the ethacrynic acid-sensitive efflux, a Na+ exchange mechanism, has
been reported in cystic fibrosis erythrocytes.  These findings
suggest that there is no fundamental abnormality in the Na+-K+
ATPase enzyme in the disease, but there may be a defect in an
ethacrynic acid-sensitive transport step.  Therefore in order to
obtain a better understanding of the cation transport defect one
should measure the binding of labelled ethacrynic-acid rather than
ouabain.
