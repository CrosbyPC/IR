An ionophore A23187-induced increase in membrane permeability to
calcium ions in culture medium produced a rabbit tracheal mucociliary
response indistinguishable from that caused by cystic fibrosis (CF)
sera on three different occasions. Specific chelation of calcium ions
with EGTA in the basal medium Eagle (BME) media with no additive or
in native CF sera abolished the mucociliary disturbances in all
cases. Increased membrane permeability to calcium may be important in
the production of the mucociliary response by CF serum factor(s) in
the tracheal assay system.
