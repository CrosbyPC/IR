Cystic fibrosis and fast moving haemoglobin [letter].

We have measured fast moving components of haemoglobin (FMH) in nine
children with cystic fibrosis without any clinical evidence of
diabetes mellitus.  The nine patients with cystic fibrosis had a mean
FMH of 9.3 which differed significantly from 97 controls with a mean
FMH of 7.6.  There was no correlation between FMH and age or FMH and
duration of disease.  The above results raise the question as to what
extent the FMH is a reflection of hyperglycaemia or insulinopenia.
