We describe here an improved method for the sweat test with the
chloride-selective electrode, after sweat production is stimulated
with pilocarpine, which gives results comparable to the more tedious
procedure of Gibson and Cooke.  Cystic fibrosis should never be
diagnosed solely on the results of any kind of sweat test; the
diagnosis must be consistent with the results of the physical
examination, history, and other studies, including a repeat of the
two sweat tests at another time.  Only by clinical examination and
repeated sweat tests can a physician confirm or rule out this
diagnosis.
