In patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) of the pancreas, optic
neuritis and peripheral neuritis have been reported to follow
treatment with chloramphenicol.  This toxic sequel appears to be
related to the dosage and duration of therapy.  In patients with
other diseases who are treated with chloramphenicol, the risk of
devastating bone marrow toxicity has been estimated to range from
1:40,000 to 1:100,000.  We have found only two reports of patients
with CF who had hematologic complications after treatment with
chloramphenicol.  We here report a 3-year-old girl who had selective
depression of the erythroid bone marrow, anorexia, weight loss,
temporary hair loss and retardation of growth after prolonged
administration of chloramphenicol.
