Professor Elliott and Dr Norman and his colleagues suggested that
excessive wrinkling of the skin after soaking in tap water might
provide an easy, cheap, and probably reliable screening test for
cystic fibrosis.  Our results show that this not true.  Marked
wrinkling after immersion of the fingers in warm tap water for 5
minutes was observed in randomly selected children with a wide
variety of conditions, including not only cystic fibrosis but also
malnutrition and renal, heart, endocrine, collagen, and other
diseases.  It was elicited even in apparently healthy individuals,
both young and adult.
