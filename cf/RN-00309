Rats treated for 7 days with reserpine develop structural changes in
the submaxillary gland that resemble those that have been reported in
cystic fibrosis. The salivary exocrinopathy is characterized by
increased amounts of PAS-reactive mucoprotein in the acinar cells and
by obstruction and dilatation of ducts by precipitated material with
the same staining characteristics as those found in the acinar
elements.
