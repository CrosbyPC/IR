The recent data suggest that we can no longer use mist tents or
intermittent aerosol therapy for cystic fibrosis patients with the
abandon previously employed.  We cannot accept such therapy as having
been proved to be effective.  We formerly believed aerosols and mists
could do little harm; we now know they can be harmful.  If such
treatment is to be used, the patient should be closely monitored
clinically and with sensitive pulmonary function tests such as
maximum expiratory flow volume curves.  It is obvious that we have
much more to learn, confirm or disprove with respect to the rationale
for and benefits of mist and aerosol therapy.
