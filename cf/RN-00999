This article describes the first time-limited psychosocial support
group for adults with cystic fibrosis (CF).The chronology of the
group is traced, focusing on issues of importance for health
professionals who work with patients with CF. Some of the issues
raised by patient members include doubts about the competence of
nonpediatricians to adequately treat CF; resentment towards "normals"
(those without CF), including health professionals; and the desire to
control as many areas of their lives as possible. Covert (ie,
unrecognized) issues, the role of staff, risks, and outcome are
detailed as a guide for others who may wish to conduct such groups.
The literature on groups for medical patients and a rationale for the
beneficial effects on the group are given.
