The pulmonary macrophages collected with bronchial mucus from
patients with cystic fibrosis and other chronic lung diseases were
investigated histochemically for acid phosphatase,
beta-glucuronidase and beta-glucosaminidase activity, and also for
mucopolysaccharide content.  In macrophages from patients with
cystic fibrosis decreased beta-glucuronidase activity was observed,
together with large cytoplasmic vacuoles suggesting storage of
partially digested material.  It thus seems very likely that apart
from the increased synthesis of mucopolysaccharides described in
cystic fibrosis by several authors, the degradation of
mucosubstances produced can be impaired.
