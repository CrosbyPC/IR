CHRONIC-DISEASE.

Two sisters are described with fatal chronic obstructive lung
disease of unknown origin.  The lung condition was clinically and
histologically indistinguishable from cystic fibrosis and the
salivary glands showed pathological changes expected in cystic
fibrosis.  Neither child had abnormal sweat electrolytes, they had
no bowel symptoms, and the pancreas was normal at necropsy.
