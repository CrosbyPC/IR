Homogenates of cultivated skin fibroblasts derived from patients with
cystic fibrosis had a higher level of UDP-galactose:ovalbumin
galactosyl transferase activity compared to fibroblasts derived from
control subjects. The activity in control subjects was 1.82 +/- 0.43
nmol galactose transferred/hr/mg protein, whereas the activity in
fibroblasts of patients was 2.95 +/- 0.77. The difference was
significant at P less than 0.01. Activity in the fibroblasts of
obligate heterozygotes was 2.15 +/- 0.60. The difference between the
activities in fibroblasts of heterozygotes and patients was
significant at P less than 0.05. The activity in control fibroblasts
could be enhanced by basic polypeptides like polylysine,
polyarginine, histone, and protamine but not by neutral or acidic
polypeptides. Fibroblasts from patients released significantly higher
amounts of a soluble form of the enzyme activity into the culture
medium than control fibroblasts.
