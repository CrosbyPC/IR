This study investigated the roles of hypoxia, pulmonary mechanics,
nutritional status and serum fatty acid composition in limiting
exercise tolerance in cystic fibrosis.  Twenty children with CF of
carrying severity performed two progressive exercise tests on a cycle
ergometer, once while breathing air, once while breathing O2. The
children with the lower maximal mid-expiratory flow rates tended to
have very little respiratory reserve at the final work load.  We
conclude that nutritional status and airway obstruction are closely
correlated with exercise tolerance in CF and that, unlike the adult
with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, exercise limiting
dyspnoea occurs in the presence of normal end-tidal CO2.
