The nitro blue tetrazolium dye test was evaluated for its usefulness
in detecting superimposed bacterial infection in 50 children with
cystic fibrosis.  No correlation of percentage of positive
neutrophils to superimposed infection, clinical status or to
bacterial organisms could be determined.  Cystic fibrosis
granulocytes generally have greater NADH oxidase activity than do
controls.
