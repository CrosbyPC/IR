Various techniques have been utilized for measurement of antibodies
against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  In general, the results of such
measurements tend to parallel each other, but the principal
functional antibodies against Pseudomonas appear to be opsonins of
the IgG and IgM immunoglobulin classes.  These antibodies are
potentiated by the complement system, activated either through the
"classical" or "alternate" pathways.  Susceptibility to fatal
infection with Pseudomonas is associated with antibody deficiency,
but this defect is usually correlated with other data regarding the
state of the host, such as underlying disease, immunosuppressive
therapy, and functional leukopenia.  Additional information is
needed on the relative protective role of IgG and IgM antibodies,
the affinity of such antibodies for viable bacteria, and the role of
antibodies against nonlipopolysaccharide antigens, such as protein
components of the cell wall and Pseudomonas exotoxins.
