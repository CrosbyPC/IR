Impaired oxygen supply and deteriorating health, in cystic fibrosis
patients, correlates with abnormal changes in the fatty acid
composition of blood lipids. As the proportion of oleates increases
and that of linoleates decreases, erythrocyte membrane interference
with the formation of intracellular oxyhemoglobin increases and
arterial oxygen pressure decreases. The physical-chemical basis for
these changes seems to be that oleic and linoleic acid differ in
their ability to undergo reversible oxygenation in response to
changes in oxygen pressure. The oxygen complex of linoleic acid
dissociates at relatively high pressures, whereas that of oleic
dissociates only at low pressures. Accordingly, excessive
substitution of oleic for linoleic acid in membrane lipids would be
expected to decrease the intracellular oxygen pressure to a level
where hemoglobin oxygenation and any other oxygen-requiring processes
would be impaired.
