The synthetic peptide N-benzoyl-L-tyrosyl-p-aminobenzoic acid is
specifically cleaved by chymotrypsin to Bz-Ty and PABA. The liberated
PABA is absorbed and excreted in the urine. Accordingly, PABA
recovery reflects intraluminal chymotrypsin activity and is an index
of exocrine pancreatic function. This test was evaluated in 24
patients with cystic fibrosis to determine its role in the diagnosis
of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Cumulative percent PABA
recovery in six hours was significantly lower in CF patients compared
with the control group. No overlap was noted between the two groups.
There was good correlation between PABA recovery, fecal chymotrypsin
activity, and coefficient of fat absorption. These findings indicate
that PABA recovery is significantly reduced in patients with CF and
steatorrhea and may prove a practical and reliable test of pancreatic
insufficiency.
