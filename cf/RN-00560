Parotid saliva samples from cystic fibrosis homozygotes,
heterozygotes and normal individuals were tested by the zeta
potential technique for secretion factor in a double-blind
experiment. There was no overlap between zeta potential reduction of
the control group and the cystic fibrosis test groups, indicating
that the zeta potential test may be detecting a unique component in
saliva of cystic fibrosis genotypes.
