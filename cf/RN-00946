In our hands, the BMC-Test Meconium has been a significant step
towards the goal of developing an ideal newborn screening test for
CF. It is easily performed, is highly specific, has reasonably high
sensitivity, and--given its limitation of identifying only patients
with CF who have intrauterine pancreatic insufficiency--is the best
method of screening newborns for CF that has been devised to date.
Many technical problems remain to be solved before the test can be
endorsed without reservation. Because the test, as currently
constituted, does not identify all potential subjects for further
testing who might have CF, it should not be made mandatory. It is,
however, better than other available screening methods for CF and can
be praised for that benefit. The concept has indicated a valuable new
direction for mass-screening possibilities and perhaps can, by future
modification, be made sensitive enough to warrant universal usage.
