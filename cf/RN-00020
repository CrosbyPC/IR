The ability to detect abnormalities of lung function in children
with asthma and cystic fibrosis by the measurement of closing
volume was studied in 205 children.  Flow volume characteristics,
routine spirometry, body plethysmography, and arterialized
oxygen tensions were studied for comparison with closing volume.
Closing volume was less sensitive in detecting disease than were
the residual volume to total lung capacity ratio, maximum expiratory
flow volume curves, and arterialized blood gases.
