Screening for cystic fibrosis (C.F.) in the newborn has been in vogue
since the introduction of a rapid simple test based in the presence
of albumin in the meconium of C.F. babies.  False-positive tests have
been observed in prematurity or when the specimen is contaminated
with blood.  We have reduced the number of false positives by
additional studies on the meconium, including detection of lactase.
Lactase activity can be detected in meconium from babies with C.F.
but not in meconium for healthy babies.  In testing 200 normal
meconiums with a negative albumin test we noted 3 positive tests for
lactase.  These 3 patients did not have C.F.  These false-positive
lactase tests could be distinguished by the addition of distilled
water to the meconium instead of lactose.  This simple test may
provide an additional or alternative method for detection of C.F. in
a screening programme.  When this test is used in addition to the
albumin test the number of false-positive albumin tests will be
reduced.
