The hypothesis that mist tent therapy decreases the viscosity of
sputum by direct liquefaction of the sputum in the lower respiratory
tract was tested in 6 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).  The first
night all patients slept without the mist tent and the first morning
sputum was collected for analysis.  The following 2 nights patients
were randomly allocated to a tent supplied by either a jet or
ultrasonic nebulizer.  The early morning sputum was analysed for
volume, viscosity, water content, and DNA content, an index of
purulence.  There was no relation between sputum viscosity and DNA
content, water content, or volume.  Furthermore, there was no
consistent relation between sputum viscosity or volume expectorated
and the presence or absence of an 8-hour stay in the tent with
either method of water nebulization.  These results therefore
suggest that mist therapy does not consistently influence sputum
viscosity or volume in patients with CF.  Above a sputum water
content of 90%, further increases in water content do not influence
viscosity.
