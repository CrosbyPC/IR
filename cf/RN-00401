A number of investigations have been used for the first time to
examine the secretory IgA (SIgA) system in different body fluids from
patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Free J-chain was detected in all
the sputum specimens examined. The isolated free secretory component
(SC) from CF sputum differed in electrophoretic mobility from the SC
isolated from normal human colostrum. In addition the free SC from
some CF saliva formed precipitin lines of partial identity with
normal human saliva or colostrum. A higher proportion of CF sera
(33%) than of normal sera (10%) contained free SC. These
investigations suggest that there may be some defect in the synthesis
and/or the assembly of the SIgA immunoglobulins, which if confirmed,
may help to explain the impaired Type I and Type III allergic
manifestations in patients with CF.
