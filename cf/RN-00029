An ear-nose-throat survey was carried out on 50 children aged 4 to
10 years with cystic fibrosis.  10% were shown to be transiently
deaf, associated with eustachian tube dysfunction.  There were no
confirmed cases of secretory otitis media.  10 children (20%) were
found to have nasal polyps or gave a history of polypectomy.  Though
a high incidence of middle ear problems in children with cystic
fibrosis has been reported in the U.S.A., neither deafness nor
secretory otitis media was found to be a problem in the group
studied.
