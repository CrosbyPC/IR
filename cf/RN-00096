With rare exceptions, patients with meconium ileus have cystic
fibrosis of the pancreas with pancreatic achylia, elevated salt
content of sweat, and characteristic pulmonary manifestations.  We
wish to report the occurrence of meconium ileus in two full-term
siblings with normal pancreatic function and no evidence of cystic
fibrosis by history of physical findings, and with normal sweat
electrolytes.  To our knowledge this is the first report of familial
meconium ileus without associated cystic fibrosis of the pancreas or
pancreatic insufficiency.
