The study evaluated the psychosocial functioning levels of a group of
chronically ill (diabetic, asthmatic, cystic fibrotic, and hearing-
impaired) children across a battery of standardized personality
instruments. The assessments were performed to provide a rigorous
test of the popular hypothesis that chronically ill children are
especially vulnerable to psychopatholgy. In contrast to this
sterotype, results across measures demonstrated the normalcy rather
than the deviance of these children. Although exceptions were noted,
the children's functional strengths and coping abilities noticeably
outweighed their weaknesses.
