Parents' understanding of genetic risk data in genetic counseling
[letter].

CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: fg.  GENETIC-COUNSELING.

HUMAN.  RISK.

Relatively little has been published on the parents' ability to grasp
the importance of empirical risk data and Mendelian-type
probabilities.  The basic problem is that for many reasons, consumers
do not know what the recurrent risks are for the various genetic
diseases, not only cystic fibrosis.  As is so often the problem in
health care, the most effective means to communicate health care
information is not used or even known.  Until the problem of
communication of probability can be worked out, I would like to make
some suggestions in trying to help those who are provided with
probability data.  Always record probability values discussed in the
genetic counseling session.  If dealing with a family physician, the
information should become a part of the medical history for future
reference.  When providing documentation of probabilities, always
include the interpretation of such probabilities through diagrams,
charts, and other simple means.  Use available pamphlets and
brochures provided by various organizations such as foundations and
departments of health.
