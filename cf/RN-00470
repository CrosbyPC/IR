In our patient, the second child of a married couple heterozygous for
cystic fibrosis , the meconium protein content was higher than that
of controls.  He has no symptoms of cystic fibrosis.  The
determination of sodium and chloride ions in the sweat excluded
homozygosity; the bromide test led us to conclude the child to be a
heterozygote.  In our patient the protein content of the meconium,
the majority of which was albumin, was two- to threefold that of the
controls.  This elevated protein content, however, was not
characteristic of homozygosity.  Our results lead us to conclude that
a high protein content of meconium does not unconditionally indicate
the homozygotic state for cystic fibrosis.  It would appear that
heterozygosity for cystic fibrosis is not completely without
abnormality.  Our findings perhaps explain "false positive" results
recorded in the literature.  High-protein content in the meconium may
be useful in the identification of heterozygotes too.
