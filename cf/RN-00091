We have recently studied an 11-year-old child with proved cystic
fibrosis in whom raised sweat sodium but normal sweat chloride
levels were obtained while she was receiving cloxacillin.  There
was no peripheral edema or hypoproteinemia, although at necropsy
there was evidence of biliary cirrhosis.  Although the sweat
abnormality might have been due to as yet unknown factors, the
temporal association with cloxacillin administration suggests a
causative relationship, and it is tempting to speculate that the
anomaly was produced in this instance by the substitution of the
cloxacillin radical for the chloride ion in the sweat during the
period of therapy.  In light of our findings it would be of
interest to know whether the infant reported by MacLean and Tripp
was receiving any drugs at the time of the initial sweat chloride
estimations and whether sodium estimations were also performed.
