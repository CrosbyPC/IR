Screening for cystic fibrosis.

CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: di.

HUMAN.  INFANT-NEWBORN.

Cystic fibrosis is a great unknown.  There is a lot of information
about the disease, but no common denominator, nothing to pull all the
pieces together.  It represents both a diagnostic and a therapeutic
challenge.  Progress is being made and perhaps someday we will be
able to understand this complex entity.
