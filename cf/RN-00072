The purpose of this communication is to discuss how the application
of one methodology - the study of the cultured human cell - has added
insight into understanding the genetic reasons for such disparate
clinical phenotypes.  A mutant genotype not recognizable and/or
understandable in vivo can often be recognized in vitro by studying
the metabolism and morphological characteristics of the cultured
cell.  Two syndromes will be used as illustrations of this principle
- the genetic mucopolysaccharidoses and cystic fibrosis.  The
patients described were selected to demonstrate how the use of cell
culture adds insight into the diagnosis of human genetic disorders.
The study of the cultured human cell has and will aid in advancing
our ability to diagnose human genetic disorders.
