The aim of a therapeutic diet is to provide a nutritionally adequate
diet from a variety of natural and/or specially prepared artificial
food substitutes for the treatment of specific clinical disorders.
The role of the dietitian is to work as a member of the medical team.
Paediatric dietetics require rather more detailed advice and help for
the parents, particularly when the diet involves calculation or
restriction of specific nutrients.  Dietary considerations in
obesity, diabetes mellitus, coeliac disease, cystic fibrosis,
carbohydrate intolerance, galactosaemia, and phenylketonuria are
discussed.
