Cystic fibrosis is inherited by single autosomal transmission.  That,
at least, is the general view; but from time to time other
suggestions are offered.  Stern et al. describe what they believe may
be a genetic variant.  The affected patients, they suggest, are
homozygous for a portion of a closely linked multigenic cystic
fibrosis locus, or have modifier genes ameliorating the pancreatic
and sweat lesions.  Do these patients really have CF?  And, if so,
are Stern et al. justified in suggesting that they differ genetically
from the "classic" CF patient?  This hypothesis may not be correct
but, until we understand the basic fundamental defect, it may be
unwise to divide CF into different genetic types on the basis of
clinical variations.
