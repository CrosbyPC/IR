This account draws on studies of young and mature lung, on normal and
morbid anatomic features, on normal adaptations as in growth, and
remodeling by disease.  Qualitative analysis of the vascular bed,
development of the pulmonary circulation, right ventricular
hypertrophy or cor pulmonale, remodeling in disease, and experimental
studies are discussed.  Pulmonary hypertension offers us a complex
pattern of structural and functional interaction; we are just
beginning to realize how complex it is.  Information on normal
structure, its modification and remodeling by growth and disease, and
appropriate techniques are available that will enable us to formulate
our questions with due regard for anatomic precision and functional
implication.  And so research will lead to understanding and, it can
be expected, to control of the undesirable aspects of pulmonary
hypertension.
