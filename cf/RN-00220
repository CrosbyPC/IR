We wish to draw the attention of your readers to a possible hazard
of feeding infants with an elemental diet.  Considerable interest is
currently being shown in the use of the artificial diet in cystic
fibrosis.  It may be used as a supplement to ordinary food or to
supply all the nutritional needs of the child.  In the latter event
we believe that it is particularly important to emphasize to the
parents the need for an additional source of dietary fat.  Clinical
evidence and animal experiments suggest that infants, because of
their rapid growth rate, are particularly at risk and that in the
absence of dietary E.F.A. they will develop deficiency symptoms in
about two months.
