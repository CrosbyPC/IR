Early investigators employed histochemical, chemical and
physiochemical techniques in an attempt to identify differences
between cystic fibrosis and control mucous secretions.  Several
mucous glycoprotein abnormalities were suggested by their studies.
In retrospect, none of these studies achieved their goal of
describing a fundamental mucous glycoprotein abnormality peculiar to
CF.  Improved methods have been devised for the collection of mucous
glycoproteins in human respiratory tract secretions and the study of
their chemical and physical properties.  Therefore, it is now
possible to make preliminary comparisons between human
tracheobronchial mucous glycoproteins from CF and non-CF sources.
General properties of mucous glycoproteins, human tracheobronchial
mucous glycoproteins, comparison of CF and non-CF tracheobronchial
mucous glycoprotein, and suggested directions for future studies of
CF mucous secretions are discussed.
