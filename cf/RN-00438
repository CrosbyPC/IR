This report summarizes selected aspects of pulmonary therapy for
cystic fibrosis.  Since the results of chronic bronchopulmonary
infection are the cause of death in most CF patients, improved
patient survival patterns may possibly be attributed in large part to
improvements in antibiotic therapy and increased therapeutic
aggressiveness.  Mist tent therapy was defined and initiated in the
1950s, but later studies of mist tent therapy have not shown
beneficial response in many patients selected for study.
Intermittent aerosol therapy continues to be employed by many
physicians to deliver medication rather than bulk liquid to the
bronchial mucosa.  Pulmonary endoscopy and lavage, expectorants,
allergic aspergillosis, pneumothorax, lobectomy, and hemoptysis are
also examined.
