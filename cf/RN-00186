Intraluminal bowel obstruction secondary to inspissated feces is a
known complication of cystic fibrosis. When seen in the older child,
it is termed "meconium ileus equivalent." We studied a case in which
nonsurgical resolution of the obstruction was obtained with N-
acetylcysteine enemas and pancreatic replacement enzymes given orally
and by enema. The pathogenesis of this disorder and the basis for the
treatment are described. Recognition of this complication and
familiarity with its medical management are important in caring for
the older child with cystic fibrosis.
