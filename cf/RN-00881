Cystic fibrosis, an autosomal recessive trait, is the most common
hereditary lethal condition among Caucasians, approximating a
prevalence of 1 per 2500 births with a carrier frequency of 1:25 in
populations originating from West Europe.  The markedly elevated
frequency of CF in a considerable proportion of the human race
presents a genetic enigma for which several solutions have been
proposed.  Genetic heterogeneity, heterozygote advantage, reduced
penetrance, genetic drift, and linkage or epistasis are discussed.
The basic defect in CF and its fundamental biochemical and
physiological ramifications are unknown.
