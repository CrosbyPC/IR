We studied the clinical and laboratory characteristics of seven
patients with sweat chloride concentration consistently between 40
and 60 mEq/liter. Each has chronic Pseudomonas bronchitis, and all
lack digestive symptoms. Laboratory findings indicate the
preservation of exocrine pancreatic function. The patients include
two of five children in one family and two of four in another. In a
third family, one of five siblings has an intermediate sweat chloride
concentration, but another has a typical fibrosis value (105
mEq/liter). One patient died of respiratory failure; results of an
autopsy showed bronchiolectasis typical of cystic fibrosis, but
minimal pancreatic changes. The data suggest a genetic basis for this
variant of cystic fibrosis. These patients may be homozygous for a
portion of a closely linked multigene cystic fibrosis locus or may
have modifier genes that ameliorate the pancreatic and sweat lesions.
