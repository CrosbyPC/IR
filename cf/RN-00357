Nitrogen- and lipid absorption coefficients were studied in 62
patients with cystic fibrosis, aged 2/12 to 12 years, and compared
with the results obtained in 20 normal children.  In 59 of the 62
patients nitrogen- and lipid absorption were grossly abnormal.
Age-linked differences were not found.  The efficacy of two
pancreatic enzymes preparations was found to be similar.  Both
preparations produced the same significant improvement in the
absorption of proteins and lipids.
