Cystic fibrosis (CF), like syphilis, could accurately be described as
"the great imitator."  Many organ systems are involved, and a clear
understanding of the disease and its many complications is a useful
exercise in understanding human physiology.  CF could be called
thick-secretion disease, because all exocrine fluids, like pancreatic
juice, are thick, or it could be called multimystery disease, because
there are so many unanswered questions about it.  Many manifestations
of CF are understandable complications of malabsorption, malnutrition
and the physical and chemical effects of abnormal exocrine secretion;
others, including the susceptibility to recurrent nasal polyps, the
hypersalinized sweat, low female fertility and male sterility, given
present knowledge, do not make physiologic sense.
