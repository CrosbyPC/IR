The Orion skin chloride measuring system had been evaluated in
children of various ages.  The method was found to give
reproducible results in nearly all cases.  Failure to obtain
reproducibility was related to inadequate sweating by the subject
and this was most likely to occur in the first week of life.  There
was generally a clear distinction between healthy children and
patients with cystic fibrosis.  The method was simple and reliable
provided that the operator had had reasonable experience with the
instrument.  One distinct advantage of the method compared with the
use of filter paper was the speed with which results were obtained.
The design of the instrument made the method completely safe and
only a few patients noticed slight tingling during iontophoresis.
The mean sweat chloride in the 'normals' was 26.9 mEq/l., compared
with 102.3 mEq/l. in the patients with cystic fibrosis.
