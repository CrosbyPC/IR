Patients who had cystic fibrosis and acute infectious exacerbations
of pulmonary disease produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa were treated
with a combination of tobramycin and ticarcillin. P. aeruginosa
recovered from patients was inhibited by lower concentrations of both
of these drugs than of gentamicin or carbenicillin. Thirteen courses
of treatment were administered to 11 patients (mean, 14.4 days). A
favorable response was seen in 11 of 12 completed courses of
treatment. Improvement was associated with decreases in white blood
cell count, temperature, and sedimentation rate. Adverse reactions
were uncommon. Although P. aeruginosa was not eradicated from the
sputum, the clinical results suggest that the combination of
tobramycin and ticarcillin may be particularly useful for treatment
of acute exacerbations of pulmonary disease in patients with cystic
fibrosis from whom P. aeruginosa is isolated.
