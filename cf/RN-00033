Cellulose acetate strip electrophoresis was found to be not
sufficiently reliable to differentiate between normal and CF
meconium, but marked differences were obtained when quantitative
immunoelectrophoretic methods were employed.  Normal meconium was
shown to contain alpha1-antitrypsin and alpha1-antichymotrypsin and
most samples contained low concentrations of albumin, and measurable
amounts of a variety of other plasma proteins.  It is suggested that
quantitative immunoelectrophoresis could be used as a means of
confirming the diagnosis of CF if positive results are obtained when
meconium specimens are screened with test strips.
