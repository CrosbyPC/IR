Established respiratory infections with mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa
in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis were treated with
conventional as well as larger doses of tobramycin. The infection was
eradicated in four of the 17 patients treated, but the duration of
follow-up study of one patient was short. It appeared that treatment
was most successful in those patients in whom the highest peak
concentrations of tobramycin in sputum were obtained. No side effects
were noted, even when tobramycin was given in large doses for two
weeks.
