A tool to assess psychosocial adjustment of school-age children with
cystic fibrosis was developed using three instruments: a
standardized open-ended parent interview, a self-administered
teacher questionnaire, and a self-administered parent demographic
data form.  The three instruments enabled the pediatric nurse
practitioner to make a clinical assessment of the child's
psychosocial adjustment.  This assessment was then checked for
validity by means of a social worker interview.  Implications for
further research are discussed.
