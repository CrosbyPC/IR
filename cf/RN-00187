The respiratory flora of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF)
frequently includes Aspergillus, and 30% of their serum samples have
been observed to contain precipitating antibody to this fungus. Serum
from 61 CF patients, 60 healthy persons, and three patients with CF
and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis was studied, using a
quantitative assay for antibody to A fumigatus. Although CF patients
had significantly higher levels of Aspergillus antibody, some
antibody was found in all serum samples from normal individuals.
Binding was immunologically specific for A fumigatus. Serum IgE
levels and dermal reactivity to Aspergillus were similar in both CF
and normal subjects. Increased levels of Aspergillus antibody in CF
patients probably reflect pulmonary colonization, which only rarely
causes infection or sensitization.
