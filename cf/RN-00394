Leucocytes from 26 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and 18 healthy
controls were investigated by migration inhibition induced by a
variety of antigens. In patients with CF cell-mediated immunity was
found to human lung and pancreatic tissue extracts as well as to
Aspergillus fumigatus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and food antigens but
not to brain, heart, or kidney. Those patients with the severest form
of the disease had the greatest impairment of cell-mediated immunity,
but this impairment could be reversed by steroid treatment. Cell-
mediated cytotoxicity may also be concerned in the pathogenesis of
CF.
