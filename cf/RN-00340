Massive hemoptysis is a potentially fatal complication of long-
standing cystic fibrosis. Lobectomy may prevent a hemorrhagic death
if the hemorrhage source can be identified and if involvement of the
remaining lung tissue is mild. Selective bronchial arteriography was
performed in six patients with cystic fibrosis to localize a lobar
source of bleeding. Arteriographic findings correlated with
bronchoscopic observations. Bronchial arteriography may be helpful
when bronchoscopy cannot be done because of continuous hemorrhage or
because the severity of the lung disease precludes general
anesthesia, but it is not an adequate substitute for bronchoscopy in
most patients.
