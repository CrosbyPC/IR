A heptavalent lipopolysaccharide vaccine against Pseudomonas has
been developed.  Clinical trials revealed a decreased incidence of
sepsis and mortality due to Pseudomonas in vaccinated patients with
burns.  If vaccinated, certain groups of immunosuppressed patients
with cancer may also have a decreased incidence of death associated
with Pseudomonas.  Trials of parenteral vaccination in patients with
cystic fibrosis show little benefit.  Adverse reactions to this
vaccine are frequent and often limit the dose given.
