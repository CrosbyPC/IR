Pancreatic glucagon and insulin were determined in 10 children with
cystic fibrosis (C.F.) and in a control group following stimulation
by an arginine infusion.  In controls the infusion of arginine
induced a prompt threefold elevation in plasma pancreatic glucagon
and about a sixfold increase in plasma immunoreactive insulin.  In
patients with C.F. the average response of both hormones was
considerably less, and the base-line concentrations for glucagon
were lower.  The data support the hypothesis that in C.F. both
alpha- and beta-cell function are affected as a result of the
underlying process.
