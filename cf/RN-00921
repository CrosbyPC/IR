A biochemical link is proposed between secretion and reabsorption in
exocrine glands, in the form of a factor (kinin E) which initiates
ion reabsorption. Activation of this factor involves arginine
esterases, and in cystic fibrosis these may be defective, preventing
the formation of kinin E. In cystic fibrosis stimulation of exocrine
glands produces abnormal reabsorption of ions, leading to the
physiological abnormalities and clinical manifestations of the
disease.
