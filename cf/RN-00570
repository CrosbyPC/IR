Recent research in cystic fibrosis has suggested at least two
theories regarding the genetic defect underlying this prevalent
disease: that a mutant gene in cystic fibrosis genotypes is
responsible for the synthesis of an altered protein that interferes
with membrane transport and mucociliary activity; and that a mutant
gene in cystic fibrosis genotypes is responsible for an enzyme
deficiency leading to the presence of undegraded metabolites that
interfere with membrane transport.  Circulating factors in cystic
fibrosis and their effects on membrane transport and mucociliary
systems are discussed, as are the search for an enzymatic deficiency
and investigations of altered metabolic pathways.  Comparison of
somatic cells from cystic fibrosis and normal genotypes is also
outlined.
