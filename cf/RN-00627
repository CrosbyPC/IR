Screening for cystic fibrosis [editorial].

CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: pc.  MASS-SCREENING.

HUMAN.  INFANT-NEWBORN.

Cystic fibrosis (mucoviscidosis) is the most common potentially
lethal autosomal recessive disease in Caucasian peoples.  Despite
much research and several promising leads there is no completely
reliable test for detecting heterozygotes, nor a test for the
identification of the affected homozygous fetus in utero.  Attention
is being focused on the value and the means of screening newborn
infants.  Pilot studies carried out in the past six years have
indicated two main possibilities.  Firstly, the examination of
meconium for excess albumin, refined to include immunoelectrophoretic
estimation of the albumin alpha-1 antitrypsin ratio, disaccharidases,
and lysosomal enzymes.  A second approach is based on the work with a
chloride-sensitive electrode, which has been modified recently to
give greater precision in measurement of neonatal sweat electrolytes.
While the tests available are reasonably accurate, collaborative
trials and respiratory could improve their efficiency still further.
Nevertheless, any screening test is presumptive only, and there must
be an adequate back-up service with a specific validated diagnostic
test.
