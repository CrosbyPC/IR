Because of the known involvement of cyclic AMP in the control of
secretion in exocrine and other mammalian cells, we have studied
cyclic AMP metabolism in cultured cystic fibrosis cells in the hopes
of demonstrating such an abnormality.  A detailed comparison of 5 CF
and 5 control strains showed that the CF cells synthesized 3 times
more intracellular cyclic AMP than controls.  In this paper, we
present data on an additional 10 CF and 10 control strains.
Measurement of intracellular cyclic AMP did not provide the same
clear-cut differences between the CF and control strains, as we had
previously observed.  The CF strains synthesized more cyclic AMP than
controls but the difference was not as large as in our earlier study
and there is considerable overlap between the two groups.  It is not
clear why these two studies should have yielded such disparate
results.
