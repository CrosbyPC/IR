VECTORCARDIOGRAPHY.

According to the World Health Organization, chronic cor pulmonale is
defined as "hypertrophy of the right ventricle resulting from
diseases affecting the function and/or the structure of the lung,
except when these pulmonary alterations are the result of diseases
that primarily affect the left side of the heart or of congenital
heart disease."  Cor pulmonale has been extensively studied and
reported in adults, but it has received relatively little attention
in the pediatric age group.  Although some parts of knowledge gained
from adult studies can be used, chronic cor pulmonale in children and
infants is quite a different entity from that usually seen in adults.
This review is primarily an attempt to clarify some of the confusion
surrounding this subject and to focus on the pediatric aspects.
Pathophysiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment are discussed.
