Mucous glycoproteins.

CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: me.  GLYCOPROTEINS: an.  MUCUS: an.

AMINO-ACIDS: an.  ANIMAL.  GLYCOPROTEINS: bi.  HUMAN.  MAMMALS.
OLIGOSACCHARIDES: an, bi.  SWINE.

While there is widespread acceptance that mucous glycoprotein
production is correlated with the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis, as
yet relatively little is known about the chemistry and control of
synthesis and secretion of these heteromacromolecules.  This
presentation describes briefly the chemistry and biosynthesis of
glycoproteins in general, but is focused on the mucous glycoproteins.
The chemistry of glycoproteins, carbohydrate to amino acid linkages,
carbohydrate structural analysis, biosynthesis, and regulation are
discussed.
