Although it is generally true that most male patients with cystic
fibrosis are infertile due to congenital atresia or absence of the
vasal structures, this finding is not invariable.  Taussig et al.
reported 2 well-studied patients with cystic fibrosis who had normal
semen analysis, and at this writing both have fathered children.  A
third patient with normal semen analysis also is known to us.  In
addition there are many instances of presumed but undocumented
paternity in these patients.  Cystic fibrosis centers estimate male
fertility at 2 to 3 per cent; although low, this figure warrants
semen analysis before assuming sterility.  In view of this, we feel
that the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis should be considered when the
vasa are absent, but it is incorrect to exclude the diagnosis on the
basis of palpable vasa.
