Fibrocystic disease is a common disease of childhood and the pancreas
is abnormal in 90% of these cases.  There is fibrosis with atrophy of
the exocrine parenchymal tissue, but islet cell tissue is rarely
involved.  Mucous glands throughout the body are grossly distended
and they secrete an abnormal viscid mucus.  Sweat glands appear
normal, but they secrete sweat with an abnormally high concentration
of electrolytes.  A characteristic feature of the disease is the
widespread chronic bronchiolitis.  This is due to the Staphylococcus
aureus which grow best in a salt-rich medium.
