In preliminary studies of short-term leukocyte cultures using
Na2-35SO4 incorporation into cetyl-pyridinium-chloride
(C.P.C.)-precipitable material (presumably glycosaminoglycans,
G.A.G.), we have found significant variation among C.F. patients
and their parents (obligate heterozygotes).  This biochemical
heterogeneity is comparable to what has been reported in fibroblast
cultures and serum.  The amount of Na2-35SO4 incorporated into
G.A.G. material found in both the incubation medium and the cells
from C.F. patients is significantly increased over normals.  A
similar analysis between normals and heterozygotes shows no
significant difference in Na2-35SO4 incorporation into G.A.G.
material of the cells.  However, 4 out of 6 heterozygotes appeared
to show a pattern of increased incorporation into material found in
the incubation medium (indicated by a higher mean than the normal
donors).  These results suggest yet another system to study the
effects of the C.F. gene.  The incorporation of Na2-35SO4 into
G.A.G. material of C.F. leukocyte cultures gives additional
evidence for the genetic heterogeneity in this disorder.
