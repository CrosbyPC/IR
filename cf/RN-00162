The purpose of the present work was to study the type of inheritance
involved in mucoviscidosis.  Analysis of the genetic relations in
mucoviscidosis performed on 26 families bears witness to a monomeric
autosomal mechanism of transmission of the character.  In contrast to
other recessive diseases, parental consanguinity plays a secondary
role in mucoviscidosis, which apparently is explained by the wide
distribution of the mucoviscidosis gene among the population.  The
observations described may be utilized in medicogenetic consultations
given to members of those families where there are children suffering
from mucoviscidosis.
