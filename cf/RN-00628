The camp on Lake Couchiching for children with CF was started in
1973.  Initially, certain changes were necessary to make the camp
suitable for CF campers.  Most of the activities normally available
to campers at Camp Couchiching are continued as usual for our CF
campers during the month of August.  Staff members spend a great
deal of time teaching the campers about the need for pancreatic
enzymes.  Each cystic child requires two or three physiotherapy
treatments every day after the inhalation of prescribed
bronchodilators and antibiotics.
