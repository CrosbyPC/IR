Secondary cystathioninuria was found in two of 46 children suffering
from tumors, leukemia, liver disease, inherited metabolic disorders,
cystic fibrosis and celiac disease. Of these two patients, one had
congenital biliary atresia and the other cytomegalovirus infection.
Seven further children had only moderately elevated excretion of
cystathionine. It is suggested that secondary cystathioninuria is
uncommon in the disease investigated.
