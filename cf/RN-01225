Development of a new test to detect carriers of the gene for cystic
fibrosis was announced.  The test involves the interaction between
red blood cells from a mouse and a small amount of a person's blood
serum.  The gene for cystic fibrosis is associated with a lectin, a
factor in the person's blood serum that acts to agglutinate (or
cluster) the red blood cells of the mouse.
