What will be our GI approach to a child with FTT syndrome? Detailed
history and physical examination will give us the clue and often the
probable diagnosis. Several laboratory tests are helpful in
establishing the fact that there is malabsorption. Among them are a
complete blood count with smear, quantitative stool fat excretion,
serum protein and chemistry screen panel, prothrombin time, and oral
tolerance and absorption--i.e., of glucose, iron, vitamin A, and
xylose. Specialized procedures may be used to nail down the
diagnosis: radiology, biopsy, duodenal intubation, etc. These should
never be employed as routine screening tests, however. In outlining a
comprehensive and successful therapy, the attending physician will
find it helpful to consider the particular pathophysiologic
mechanisms of a specific disease. Exact diagnosis makes the therapy
both rational and effective.
