Two major classes of lipoproteins, low density and high density, are
decreased in the serum of patients with cystic fibrosis; major
apoproteins are also decreased. Since essential fatty acids and
certain fat-soluble vitamins depend on lipoproteins for transport in
the serum, knowledge of lipoprotein levels in cystic fibrosis
patients could prove valuable in understanding (i) the basis for the
abnormally low serum levels of these fatty acids and vitamins and
(ii) the effects of therapies involving these molecules.
