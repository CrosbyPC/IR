The diagnosis, management and prognosis of 17 infants with cystic
fibrosis  (CF) and severe respiratory disease were reviewed for the
period 1968 to 1972.  The clinical course of these infants was
characterized by a bronchiolitis-like syndrome with failure to
thrive and malnutrition.  Arterial blood gases demonstrated marked
hypoxemia (mean PaO2, 36.5 mm Hg).  Tracheal cultures showed a
predominance of gram-negative microorganisms with Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli
predominating.  Corticosteroids were used in all patients.  Despite
vigorous therapy including antibiotics there was a 60% mortality.
A delay in the diagnosis of CF from the onset if respiratory
symptoms with a mean of six weeks was considered an important factor
affecting survival.  This data supports the need for developing a
reliable screen test for CF at birth.
