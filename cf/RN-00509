Since kappa-chain deficiency is an unusual condition, we studied the
clinical and laboratory findings in a patient with this deficiency.
The patient had cystic fibrosis with concurrent malabsorption,
diabetes mellitus and IgA deficiency. The serum levels of IgM and IgG
were 0.85 and 7.22 mg per milliliter, respectively. Kappa type IgM
and IgG was not present in serum and external secretions; gamma, mu
and lambda chains were probably polyclonal in character. Antibodies
against kappa chains were not detected in either the patient or the
mother. Plasma cells containing kappa-type immunoglobulins were
absent in jejunum samples and bone marrow; kappa-chainbearing B
lymphocytes could not be detected in blood and bone marrow. The serum
of one of the patient's sisters contained trace amounts of kappa-type
immunoglobulins. The patient displays a complete absence of kappa-
type immunoglobulins, probably owing to a genetic defect.
