Lipids from the particulate material obtained from pulmonary lavage
of patients with asthma and cystic fibrosis were isolated and
characterized. In both cases, lipids constituted 30 to 40 per cent of
the dry insoluble material and phosphatidylcholine was the
predominant lipid. Significant amounts of phosphatidylethanolamine
and phosphatidyglycerol were present. Hexosyl ceramides,
spingomyelin, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, and
lyso(bis)phosphatidic acid were present as minor lipid components.
Appreciable quantities of neutral lipids were also found. Significant
amounts of lysophosphatides and free fatty acids were present only in
the lavage sediment from patients with asthma, and not in patients
with cystic fibrosis. Phosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidycholine,
sphingomyelin, and phosphatidylglycerol of asthmatic lavage, but not
cystic lavage, were highly saturated, containing mostly palmitic
acid.
