Fibroblasts derived from individuals with mucopolysaccharidosis, an
inborn error of metabolism, have been found to be more easily
transformed by simian virus 40 than are cells derived from normal
individuals. The increased susceptibility does not seem to depend
upon changes in glycoprotein at the cell surface. Repeated
observations were necessary to demonstrate these differences, and we
do not believe that this test is suitable for routine screening for
cancer susceptibility.
