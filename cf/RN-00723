The intestinal brush border is a complex organelle that contains
hydrolytic enzymes, receptors, other proteins involved in transport
and contractile proteins.  In this article, we review the molecular
organization of brush-border proteins within the whole membrane, and
discuss their synthesis and turnover.  This knowledge provides a
framework for understanding the mechanisms by which certain diseases
are associated with changes in brush-border proteins.
