Methods for the rapid semiquantitative analyses of trypsin and
chymotrypsin in faeces samples have been developed.  The faecal
sample is shaken with pH 8.2 buffer and solutions containing enzyme
substrate, buffer and indicator are added.  The sample is incubated
at 37 degrees C for a period dependent on the amount of faecal
material present and the colour noted.  A change in colour from
violet to yellow (trypsin) or green to rose (chymotrypsin) indicates
the presence of the enzyme.  A screening trial using these tests is
being carried out at St. Helen's Maternity Hospital in Auckland.
