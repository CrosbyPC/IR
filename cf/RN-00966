The rat jejunum bioassay has been shown to be capable of identifying
both the cystic fibrotic homozygote and heterozygote and therefore
would appear to have great potential as a screening test for the
latter.  It is suggested that the cystic fibrosis factor does not
influence sodium reabsorption by inhibiting an active sodium
reabsorption mechanism but rather by inhibiting passive sodium entry
into the cell.
