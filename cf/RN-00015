Three of the 4 women in a cystic fibrosis clinic who used a combined
form of oral contraceptive developed acute polypoid cervicitis.  In
one woman, the polyp recurred on reinstitution of the medication.
There was resolution of the polyp in each instance on
discontinuation of the drugs.  In 2 of the 3 affected women, there
was coincidental deterioration of respiratory status.  Therefore, it
is suggested that cystic fibrosis patients who are using oral
contraception be observed closely regarding pulmonary and
gynecologic status.
