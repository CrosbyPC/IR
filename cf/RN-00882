Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease affecting mainly Caucasians.
All exocrine glands are obstructed, causing multiple manifestations.
The most lethal aspect is the pulmonary involvement.  Early diagnosis
and treatment influence prognosis.  The sweat test is the diagnostic
tool; it must be done in a center where it is performed frequently
and where quality control is available.  Specific therapy varies from
center to center, but all agree on a consistent, comprehensive
approach to management.  One must be acutely aware of the
psychosocial aspects when caring for children with cystic fibrosis.
