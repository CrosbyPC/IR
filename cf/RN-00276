A four year old Chinese girl of parents who emigrated to Singapore
from South China was found to be suffering from bronchiectasis as a
result of repeated chest infections, and failure to thrive.
Investigations confirmed the bronchiectasis, and, in the course of
attempting to elucidate the course, sweat Cl and sweat Na were found
to be raised.  The patient occasionally passed soft bulky stools and
the Vitamin A absorption test was abnormal.  The pathogenesis,
problems in diagnosis and the genetics are briefly reviewed.  This is
the first proved case of cystic fibrosis occurring in a child of pure
Chinese stock, and the first to be described in South-East Asia.
Cystic fibrosis occurring in non-Caucasians in reviewed.
