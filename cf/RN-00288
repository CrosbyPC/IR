In an investigation of the effects of intestinal malabsorption on
plasma-lipids, we compared the fatty-acid composition of the
serum-lecithin of 23 patients with malabsorption from a variety of
different causes and found similar changes irrespective of the
underlying cause of the malabsorption.  The only exception to this
was that classical E.F.A. deficiency was found only in patients
whose malabsorption was due to massive small-bowel resection.  All
other causes of malabsorption gave rise to changes identical to
those found by other workers in C.F.; there is thus no reason to
postulate an additional metabolic abnormality specific to C.F.  The
relatively normal amounts of arachidonic acid reported in some
E.F.A. deficient patients may not be entirely due to arachidonic
acid.
