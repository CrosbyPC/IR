The primary goal of this investigation has been to disclose special
characteristics among children with Cystic Fibrosis and their
families and to focus on important consequences of the illness.  The
main issues have been: (1) to explore the quality and the magnitude
of psychological problems that CF imposes on the child and on its
parents; (2) to investigate how the CF child experiences and reacts
to its illness; (3) to assess if the CF child differs emotionally,
intellectually or in visual-motor functioning from peers; (4) to see
how the parents adapt to their child's condition and cope with the
problems; (5) to assess the need of help and how it can be given.
