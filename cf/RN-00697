The value of the Boehringer-Mannheim (B-M) meconium test for routine
screening for cystic fibrosis has been questioned recently because
of the high proportion of false negative results.  This report
presents our observations on the validity of the B-M meconium test.
Our findings show that the B-M meconium test may contribute to false
negative results even when the exocrine pancreatic function of a
newborn infant with CF is abnormal.  Our observation supports the
doubts expressed recently in regard to the validity of the B-M
meconium test in screening neonates for cystic fibrosis.
