31 children with cystic fibrosis (CF) subdivided into three groups of
age were studied before and after treatment with lyophilized pancreas
and compared to 27 controls. CF was characterized by lower
phospholipid, cholesterol and polyunsaturated fatty acid plasma
concentrations and reduced coefficient of fat absorption. Treatment
tended towards normalization of these values. With age
polyunsaturated fatty acids increased in normals but not in CF. The
significant correlations existing between fat absorption coefficient
and polyunsaturated fatty acid percentage in neutral lipids of CF
children suggests the use of the latter percentage as index of the
stage of malabsorption.
