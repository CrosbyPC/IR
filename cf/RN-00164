This preliminary clinical study is of the ability of a multivalent
heat-killed whole cell gram-negative bacilli vaccine to be tolerated
and to evoke an antibody response in groups of patients who have a
manifest need for increased resistance to gram-negative bacilli.
Three groups of patients were studied: 35 burn patients; seven small
children with cystic fibrosis; and 35 patients who were about to
undergo coronary vein grafts.  The results of vaccination were
different in each of the three groups of patients that were
vaccinated.
