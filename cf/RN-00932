Malabsorption in infancy and childhood can roughly be defined as a
condition of inadequate growth in spite of seemingly adequate
nutrition and is accompanied by excessive excretion of food
components in the stools.  Acquired lactase deficiency, the
introduction of sugar in the diet, coeliac disease, and cystic
fibrosis are discussed.
