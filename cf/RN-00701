This paper presents an overview of research on disability, and
integrates rehabilitation research with the mainstream of scientific
activity.  Research on disability is an applied science which uses
the general tools of scientific method in solving specific problems.
Research on disability embraces a wide variety of physical,
intellectual, and emotional conditions.  The psychological aspects
of physical disabilities are especially stressed in the adaptation
to lost functions.  Examples of research are given from spinal cord
injury, end-stage renal disease, facial disfigurement, and cancer of
the larynx.
