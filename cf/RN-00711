We have studied seven patients with C.F. and ten normal children and
have confirmed the low levels of E.F.A. both in plasma and in
red-cell membrane in the C.F. group.  We would like to report here
preliminary results on the fatty-acid pattern of the lecithin
fraction of bronchial mucus in the same group of patients and
controls.  Content of palmitic acid was lower and that of oleic acid
was higher in the C.F. patients than in normal children.  This
abnormality in the fatty-acid composition of the lecithin of the
mucus could be an important finding in relation to the respiratory
symptoms in C.F.  Some experimental work supports this hypothesis.
