Reports of children with cystic fibrosis living well whilst on
intensive treatment can be covered by allegations that their disease
must be basically mild.  More revealing evidence comes from the
longterm survival studies done by Professor Warren Warwick, of the
University of Minnesota.  The introduction of antibiotics have
allowed the children to live loner, but 3/4 were dead by aged 10
years.  Physiotherapy given after infections prolonged lives so that
half were still alive at 10 years - but still faced a relentless
death rate.  Prophylactic - daily - physiotherapy produced a
doubling of survival at 20 years from under 30% to over 60%.  I do
not deny for a moment that daily physiotherapy with inhalations is a
great strain on the family, but it is not as great as the strain of
watching the slow and relentless decline of the child which, with
racking cough and persistent dyspnoea, is anything but peaceful.
