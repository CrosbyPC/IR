It has been observed that most cystic fibrosis patients lack an
alpha2 macroglobulin-protease complex and that binding of trypsin and
other proteases to alpha2 macroglobulin is lower in plasma of CF
patients than in that of normal controls.  We therefore decided to
study the interaction of trypsin with plasma proteins of CF patients.
Here we report that trypsin-binding IgG (TbIgG) is present in 80% of
CF patients and in 30% of their mothers, but not in 97% of normal
controls or in other relatives of CF patients.  Experimental evidence
supports the antibody nature of TbIgG, which is presumably produced
against the porcine trypsin ingested by CF patients as pancreatic
extracts for substitutive enzyme therapy.
