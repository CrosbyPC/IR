The problem of proper diet to children and infants with cystic
fibrosis is continuously discussed.  This paper deals with the diet
for CF infants younger than one year.  The basic view is that the
diet should be as close to the 'normal baby' diet as possible, partly
to ensure normal growth and development, and partly to avoid extra
work for the families with CF infants.  Infants suffering from CF
were given lactose-free diet until they reached the age of one year.
The weight increased more rapidly than in CF patients given the
traditional CF diet with low fat and high protein.  Furthermore, it
was not necessary to give increased amounts of calories to the
infants given lactose-free diet, nor did they receive additional
fat-soluble vitamins.
