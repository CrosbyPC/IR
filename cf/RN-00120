At present it is extremely doubtful if mass-population screening for
any inherited metabolic disease other than phenylketonuria should be
established beyond the few pilot studies at present in progress.  For
many diseases, although early detection is clearly desirable or the
technical means of screening are available, even the establishment of
pilot surveys is not yet indicated.  Instead, methods of screening
more limited populations at risk for particular disorders within a
nationally coordinated administrative structure should be
established.  Those with experience of mass screening for more than
one inherited metabolic disease must surely be convinced that in new
programmes launched prematurely the harm caused by incomplete
detection of cases or recognition of disorders whose management is
uncertain or unavailable can far outweigh any benefits.
