In a recent study, we attempted to assess the personality
characteristics of both mothers and fathers of children with cystic
fibrosis.  In all, more than 150 such parents were interviewed.
During the course of the interview, the Taylor manifest anxiety
scale, Fouldes' personality inventory, and the 16 PF test form A
were used.  It was apparent that these parents represented a wide
range of personality types, and differed in no way from the general
population.
