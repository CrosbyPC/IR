Detection of cystic fibrosis protein by electrofocusing [letter].

BLOOD-PROTEINS: an.  CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: bl.

HUMAN.  ISOELECTRIC-FOCUSING.

Wilson et al. reported a biophysical assay for cystic fibrosis that
employed isoelectric focusing of serum proteins.  Their work appeared
to establish the presence of a definitive marker for CF serum in the
form of a protein band that was not present in normal serum.  We
tried to repeat their work and found that the background color of the
fresh electropherograms made it rather difficult to detect
unequivocally the presence or absence of bands in the appropriate pH
region in CF vs. control serum.  However, when the gels were
photographed using Kodak Panatomic X film and a Wratten 25 A red
filter, the color response and contrast of the film eliminated this
interference to a great extent and it was much easier to detect the
putative band.  We agree partially with the observations of Wilson
and Fudenberg, but would like to stress that the technique is not a
diagnostic test.
