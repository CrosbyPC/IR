Gastric mucosal biopsies from eight new untreated patients with
cystic fibrosis (CF) and two normal subjects were studied by
quantitative techniques of electron microscopy (EM) to determine
whether presecreted gastric mucus was more compact (viscid) than
normal.  Analysis of variance techniques show no differences between
means of all groups studied.  These observations suggest that mucus
may not be viscid prior to secretion.  Electron microscopy of
gastric mucus does not appear to be of diagnostic value in CF.
