Cystic fibrosis is the most common autosomal recessive disorder in
Great Britain, Central Europe and North America and it affects 1 in
2000 live born children.  Does the antibiotic treatment in cystic
fibrosis differ from the treatment of respiratory infection in other
conditions?  The cystic fibrosis patient not only suffers progressive
deterioration in respiratory function; he often has dangerous
complicating conditions culminating in super-infection by highly
resistant organisms.  The basic principle of antibiotic therapy must
be rigidly applied in cystic fibrosis.  The first principle is to
identify the pathogen and its susceptibility to antibiotics.  The
second principle is to ensure that the chosen antibiotic reaches the
site of infection.  The third principle is that the antibiotic
therapy ought to complement the immunological defences of the
patient.  A fourth principle is that no therapy must be given
without first deciding upon the criteria which will be acceptable as
indicating clinical improvement.
