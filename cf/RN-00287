In three literature reports the linoleic acid (L.A.) levels for
cystic fibrosis (C.F.) compared to controls are always more
significantly lower than arachidonic acid (A.A.).  Similarly the
percentage lowering is also more for L.A. than A.A.  There is, thus,
no "overwhelming" evidence for a blocked or absent desaturase and
the cause of the E.F.A. deficiency must be elsewhere.  We have found
up to 2.5% of the total fatty acids in both serum and red cells to
be C20:3-omega-9.  All of our C.F. patients have shown this acid at
some stage and, for most, it is a permanent feature of their fatty
acid profile.  It has been reported that C20:3-omega-9 would
probably act as an inhibitor of prostaglandin formation from A.A.
and it is interesting to conjecture on whether this could account
for some of the symptoms of C.F.  C20:3-omega-9 would also be
incorporated into P.I. and could then alter membrane properties.
