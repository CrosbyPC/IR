The recent interesting report on cystic fibrosis with edema and
falsely negative sweat test prompted us to report a similar case.
The previously reported similar cases and this one suggest that
when cystic fibrosis is suspected in an edematous infant and the
sweat chloride or sodium concentration is within the normal range,
the test should be repeated after the edema has disappeared.
