Intracisternal granules (Palade, 1956) or inclusion bodies occurring
within the cisternae of the rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum
have been observed not only in normal conditions, but also in some
experimental conditions.  In this paper, such intracisternal
inclusion bodies were induced or found in a variety of animals
following chemical administrations, artificial hibernation and cold
exposure, and also with cystic fibrosis.  These inclusion bodies are
tentatively classified into 6 types based upon their morphological
aspects.  The formation, fate and significance of these bodies are
also discussed.
