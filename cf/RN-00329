The importance of regular efficient postural drainage cannot be
emphasised too strongly.  Most parents of pre-school and primary
school children are young enough to be physically able to play a
major role in the routine physiotherapy treatment.  The parents will
require a great deal of support and encouragement from the
physiotherapist, who must be ready to organise professional
physiotherapy at crisis times in the family as well as in the event
of an exacerbation.
