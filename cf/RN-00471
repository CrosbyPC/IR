The composition of sweat and its relationship to the condition and
site of collection are of interest in environmental physiology,
dermatology, and the study of cystic fibrosis.  This study was
undertaken to compare the concentrations of sodium and chloride in
whole body sweat of normal control patients and of CF patients
obtained by thermal stimulation with samples collected locally by
pilocarpine iontophoresis.  Electrolyte concentrations in whole body
sweat samples correlated in a highly significant fashion with sodium
and chloride values found in arm patch sweat.  Patients with CF,
however, showed significantly higher sodium and chloride
concentrations in arm patch sweat and whole body sweat, and increased
sodium excretion rates.
