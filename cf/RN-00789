Is sulphated blood-group substance in pancreas a factor in cystic
fibrosis?.

The present study showed that the pancreas of two monkey species
contained sulphated blood-group substance. Such strongly anionic
molecules are known to bind calcium, and their solutions form gels in
the presence of cations. It is suggested that such a mechanism may be
involved in cystic fibrosis.
