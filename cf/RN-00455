Caries prevalence, oral hygiene index, submandibular gland
hypertrophy, occlusion, dental hypoplasia, and staining of permanent
teeth were evaluated in 63 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) who
were maintained on a regimen of broad-spectrum antibiotics and oral
pancreatin, and the findings were compared with those of their near-
aged siblings. Gland hypertrophy and dental staining were increased
in patients with CF whereas caries was significantly decreased. No
other significant differences were found.
