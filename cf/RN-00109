I have observed that the skin of children with cystic fibrosis
wrinkles excessively early when soaked in tap water.  This physical
sign is highly reliable irrespective of the degree of nutrition of
the patient.  It is sometimes seen in infants with marasmus.
Normal skin wrinkles eventually to exposure to water (except that
from the Dead Sea).  It is possible that the disorder of salt flux
in cystic fibrosis is connected with the apparent excessive
hypertonic reactivity of the skin.  Three minutes and a bowl of
water might provide a cheap screening test for this condition.
