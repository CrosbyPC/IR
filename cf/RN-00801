Fetal or neonatal volvulus is a rare event and is usually associated
with an anatomic defect.  Massive abdominal distension secondary to a
ruptured or unruptured volvulus has never been reported as a cause of
obstructed labor.  The present report documents such a case,
secondary to chemical peritonitis resulting from a ruptured midgut
volvulus.  This case demonstrates an unusual presentation of presumed
cystic fibrosis with meconium ileus and volvulus which led to
ischemic infarction and perforation of the small bowel.  This case
likewise emphasizes the need to consider the presence of other fetal
anomalies, such as omphalocele or gastroschisis, when the usual
maneuvers fail to relieve shoulder dystocia.
