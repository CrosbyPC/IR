Rickets is reported in a 19 year old white man with cystic fibrosis
in whom pancreatic and hepatic involvement was advanced. There was
evidence of secondary hyperparathyroidism with proximal renal tubular
acidosis, aminoaciduria, phosphaturia and hypophosphatemia. Treatment
with oral pancreatic and parenteral vitamin D supplements led to full
recovery of the rachitic syndrome and the proximal renal tubular
dysfunction.
