It has always seemed to me that the use of the Exercise Lability
Index (ELI) distorts results and may be misleading because a falsely
high value for lability is obtained when the PEF at rest is low.  It
is incorrect to compare percentage values from such patients with
percentage values from those with figures at rest which are near to
normal.  The Jones Liability Index avoids this distortion.  I do not
suggest that a proportion of CF patients do not have abnormal
lability but would maintain that the ELI introduces inaccuracy which
may blur the distinction between CF and other respiratory conditions
and may lead to the postulation of problems concerning lability in
CF which do not necessarily exist.  Failure to use a bronchodilator
agent to reinforce brief exercise may also cause distortion but in
the opposite direction.
