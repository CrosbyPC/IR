The autosomal recessively inherited disorder cystic fibrosis is
clinically identified in patients by the pathognomonic finding of
increased electrolyte content in the exocrine secretion sweat.  Two
other observations merit mention.  First, the demonstration by Magos
of the existence of a factor in CF sweat which interfered with
reabsorption of sodium in the rat parotid.  Secondly is the existence
of a CF serum component which interfered with ciliary rhythm in organ
culture systems.  Our investigations in cystic fibrosis have been
oriented towards the establishment of a possible pedigree of causes
which will unite all these observations and secondly to develop a
possible method for heterozygote detection.  Cystic fibrosis RNA is
relatively undermethylated in comparison with contrast cultures.  In
addition, CF heterozygote fibroblast cultures also appear
undermethylated.  Our interpretation of these data do not imply a
primary defect of RNA methylases in cystic fibrosis but rather
suggested a defect elsewhere in biochemical sequences involving
methionine.
