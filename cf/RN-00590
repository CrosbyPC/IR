Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in cystic fibrosis.  Diagnostic and
prognostic significance of pseudomonas aeruginosa precipitins
determined by means of crossed immunoelectrophoresis.  A survey.

The purpose of the first part of the present work is to review the
literature concerning the lower respiratory tract infections and the
antimicrobial resistance mechanisms in cystic fibrosis patients.
The second part of the work deals with the most important
therapeutical problem in cystic fibrosis today, viz. the Pseudomonas
aeruginosa lung infection.  A survey is made of the investigations
of the present author and his colleagues into the immune response
against Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and the literature
concerning these subjects.  Furthermore, the possible mechanisms of
tissue damage in the respiratory tract of cystic fibrosis patients
during these infections are discussed.
