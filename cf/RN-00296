Vitamin E has been claimed to prevent, ameliorate, or cure skin
disease, warts, ulcers, strabismus, baldness, frostbite, arthritis,
jaundice, muscular dystrophy, diabetes, liver dysfunction, thyroid
disease, sexual impotence, and aging.  The vitamin has recently been
added to cosmetics, used as a deodorant, and alleged to be an
effective antidote to air pollution.  There is no evidence that large
doses of vitamin E are effective for the prevention or treatment of
heart disease or any other human disorder, except in premature
infants and possibly in patients with diseases that impair fat
absorption.  Adverse effects, though rare, have resulted from
ingestion of large doses of vitamin E.
