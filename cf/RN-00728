The spinal cords of 19 percent of patients dying with cystic fibrosis
after 5 years of age showed posterior column degeneration. The risk
did not appear to increase with advancing age. None of these patients
had findings of pernicious anemia or spinocerebellar degeneration.
The lesions had been undetected clinically. It is possible that
nutritional, toxic, or hereditary factors may play a role in
producing this lesion.
