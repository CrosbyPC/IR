Four patients are presented aged 14 to 20 years with cystic fibrosis
and recurrent purpura of the legs. They have polyclonal increase of
Ig but no intermediate complexes demonstrable by ultracentrifugation.
The 4 patients differ from other patients with cystic fibrosis by a
rapid deterioration of the clinical condition after the establishment
of permanent pulmonary infection, and also by their proneness to
Haemophilus influenzae infections. The clinical and laboratory
findings are compatible with the diagnosis of Waldenstrom's
hypergammaglobulinemic purpura. The heterogeneity of this syndrome is
discussed.
