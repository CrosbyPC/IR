Three patients with cystic fibrosis were noted to have swelling of
knee and ankle joints during exacerbation of their lung disease.
Synovial fluid was analyzed in one patient and the synovium underwent
biopsy in another. These studies excluded other causes of arthritis
but did not contribute any new information on the nature of secondary
hypertrophic osteoarthropathy. Radiological examination of long bones
confirmed the diagnosis of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy in all three
patients. Since many patients with cystic fibrosis survive longer,
more instances of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy are expected in the
future.
