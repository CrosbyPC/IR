Analyses of serum lipids of children with cystic fibrosis (CF) have
indicated a deficiency in essential fatty acids (EFA). In view of a
report that intravenous administration of soybean oil emulsions
normalized sweat sodium values in CF children, we studied the effects
of orally administered essential fatty acids (as corn oil) for one
year. Some improvement was noted in all patients, but no one
consistent factor predominated. However, arachidonic acid, which was
found only in trace amounts or was absent in sera of all children
with CF before the clinical trial, was increased significantly in the
sera after the oral administration of EFA for one year. Other
findings included a significant decrease in sweat sodium and T3 in
most patients.
