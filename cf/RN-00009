A family is presented in which celiac sprue and cystic fibrosis
occurred within the same sibship.  A cousin of the index case was
also discovered to have celiac sprue.  The genetics and incidence of
both conditions is reviewed.  It is estimated that the likelihood of
this association occurring on the basis of chance in this family is
1 in 50,000.
