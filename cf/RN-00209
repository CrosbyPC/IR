Early insulin response to rapid intravenous injection of glucose was
studied in 7 cases of cystic fibrosis aged 8 months to 9 1/2 years.
Plasma insulin was measured with a radioimmunological method. Blood
glucose values were determined and the glucose disappearance rate
(kG) calculated. In all children except the youngest one the early
insulin response values were low compared with normal children. The
kG-values were normal and correlated neither to the duration of
clinical symptoms, nor to the patients' actual clinical condition
measured by means of the Shwachman score. The explanation of the
decreased insulin response is probably the progressive fibrosis of
the pancreas. This may also explain the reported increased incidence
of diabetes mellitus in cystic fibrosis. Comparison is made with the
condition in pancreatic fibrosis in rabbits, produced through duct
ligation.
