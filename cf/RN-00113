Assessment of intelligence by the "draw-a-man" test and school
reports has shown that, despite severe early malnutrition in children
who had neonatal resection of ileum, the frequency of mental
retardation is no higher than in the normal population.  The scores
in patients with cystic fibrosis were also similar to the control
group.
