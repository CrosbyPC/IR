In most patients with cystic fibrosis growth failure occurs because
of malabsorption or moderate to severe pulmonary disease, or both.
Occasionally, growth lag is seen in patients that is disproportionate
to the severity of the primary disease.  Profound growth failure is a
major characteristic of Crohn's disease in children.  This report
documents the first association of these two diseases in the same
patient in the United States and shows how Crohn's disease alters the
gastrointestinal manifestations of cystic fibrosis.  An adolescent
patient with cystic fibrosis, anemia, fistulae, arthritis and calcium
oxalate stones was proven to have Crohn's disease by microscopic
evaluation of surgically resected terminal ileum and colon.
