A false-positive 111In-labeled leukocyte scan was obtained in a girl
with cystic fibrosis and infection. There was focal accumulation of
111In activity in the abdomen and marked pulmonary uptake. Surgical
exploration and postmortem examination revealed no abdominal
abnormality. The abnormal activity was apparently due to swallowed
sputum which contained labeled leukocytes. Broader clinical
implications are discussed.
