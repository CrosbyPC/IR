Dr Hosli and Esther Vogt reported that the alpha-mannosidase and acid
phosphatase activities of cystic fibrosis plasma assayed at pH 5.4
are abnormally thermolabile at 41 degrees and 36.5 degrees C,
respectively, and that the levels of residual activity after heat
inactivation clearly distinguish between CF patients, CF carriers,
and normal subjects.  We have repeated these experiments under
identical conditions and found no differences between the three
groups.
