The aim of our clinical study was to find if prolonged tobramycin
therapy can prevent further rapid deterioration in cystic fibrosis
patients.  Eleven courses of treatment were given to the nine
patients.  Eight of these markedly improved their physical activity
and gained weight.  However, only in four of these patients was
clinical improvement correlated with an improved radiogram.
Pseudomonas was eradicated from the sputum of only four patients
during therapy but reappeared in three of them before the end of
therapy.  Clinical improvement and negligible side effects suggest
treatment of exacerbating Pyocyaneus bronchopneumonia with prolonged
tobramycin therapy.  Dosage should be higher than 5 mg/kg/day with
strict control of tobramycin blood level and awareness of side
effects.
