Killing of fibroblasts by dexamethasone or dibutyryl adenosine
3',5'-monophosphate is not a valid test for cystic fibrosis.

Assays based on the counting of total cells and of colony-forming
cells were used to demonstrate that neither dexamethasone nor
dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) kills human
fibroblasts under a variety of conditions. These results contradict
those of previous studies showing that dexamethasone and dibutyryl
cyclic AMP kill a higher percentage of fibroblasts from normal humans
than from individuals with cystic fibrosis.
