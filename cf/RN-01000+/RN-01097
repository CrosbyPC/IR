CHILD.  CHILD-PRESCHOOL.  FEMALE.  HUMAN.  MALE.

Five children 2 to 10 years of age with cystic fibrosis developed
transient episodic arthritis.  Although polyarticular in
distribution, only one joint might be involved during each attack.
No laboratory or radiologic evidence of juvenile chronic arthritis
was present and no permanent joint limitation was noted.
