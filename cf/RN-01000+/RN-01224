The change of life expectancy of cystic fibrosis patients has
stimulated our interest in assessing the understanding and
utilization of genetic information by adult CF patients and how this
may affect their coping mechanism(s).  The present study was designed
to obtain information in these areas with the expectation that more
effective genetic counseling might be developed for this enlarging
group of patients.  Knowledge of genetics, attitudes concerning
reproduction, attitudes toward prenatal diagnosis, and attitudes
toward a carrier identification study are reported for 25 males and
15 females with proven cystic fibrosis.
