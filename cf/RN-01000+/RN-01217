From a review of 2,000 autopsies of children, 16 cases of extensive
necrosis and scarring fibrosis of the myocardium were found. These
lesions involved mainly the left ventricle and spared the
endocardium, the pericardium, and the coronary vessels. These
necrotic of fibrotic heart lesions were found to be closely
associated with various pancreatic diseases: cystic fibrosis (11
cases), pancreatic lipomatosis (2 cases), extensive small bowel
resection (3 cases, 2 of which were associated with acute
interstitial pancreatitis). To explain these unexpected associations,
two hypotheses can be put forth: (1) The lack of absorption of some
presently undetermined substances indispensable for the correct
trophicity of the myocardium, and (2) the release in the blood of
proteolytic enzymes with consecutive activation of phlogistic
substances such as kinins.
