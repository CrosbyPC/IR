Mauriac syndrome is characterised by hepatomegaly, glycogen
infiltration of the liver, retarded sexual maturation, and short
stature in diabetic children.  We report the first example of Mauriac
syndrome, in a patient clinically malnourished and edematous, who had
a transient false positive sweat test.  Malnourished children who
have a positive sweat test should have repeated sweat tests once the
malnourished state has been reversed.  This would eliminate error in
the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.
