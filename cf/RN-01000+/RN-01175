Several reports have indicated the presence of abnormally high
amounts of sulphate in the mucous glands of patients with cystic
fibrosis.  Bearing these facts in mind, we suspected that abnormal,
over-sulphated, and strongly anionic, glycoproteins might be involved
in the pathogenesis of CF.  The present study was carried out to
determine whether sulphated blood-group substances occur in normal
pancreatic tissue.  The distribution of sulphate over the exocrine
part of pancreas does coincide with the distribution of blood-group
substance previously observed by fluorescent microscopy.  We
therefore find it very likely that the sulphate and blood-group
substance are associated with the same glycoprotein molecule.  Since
blood-group substance has been demonstrated in many secretions in
man, and since high amounts of sulphate have been found in the
mucous glands in CF, such a mechanism is possible in many locations
and may thus offer an explanation for the multiorgan involvement in
CF.
