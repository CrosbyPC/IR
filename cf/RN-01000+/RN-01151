We explored 44 children suffering from cystic fibrosis with
predominant pulmonary involvement and followed in particular the
course of illness of 30 of these patients during an average period of
4 years.  We were impressed by the enormous variability of the
pulmonary symptomatology in these children.  The question arose
whether this clinical impression is supported by the finding of the
thorax radiograph and the results of the lung functions tests and the
blood gas measures at rest and on exercise.  From the clinical point
of view, there is a possibility to make a classification of severity
in pulmonary aspects of this disease.  Because of the large ranges of
the score values a clear distinction of the severity could only be
possible if large groups of patients were to be compared.  For the
interindividual comparison the cumulative evaluation of a clinical
score, the chest radiograph and the lung function tests are
indispensable.  Only the continuous follow-up of these examinations
allows one to notice, in time, a progressive lung involvement with
its degenerative changes.
