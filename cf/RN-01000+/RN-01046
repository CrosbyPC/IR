To explain why the single-breath carbon monoxide diffusing capacity
(Dsb) was, on the average, elevated in 163 asthmatic subjects and 175
patients with cystic fibrosis, we simulated this elevation in ten
normal subjects by having them perform the test for Dsb through an
inspiratory obstruction. This resulted in an 18 percent increase in
Dsb corrected for pulmonary volume. Inhalation of a bronchodilator
drug was associated with relief of obstruction and a fall in the
corrected Dsb in 31 asthmatic subjects but did not change either the
obstruction or the corrected Dsb in 17 patients with cystic fibrosis.
We suggest that elevated Dsb in asthma and cystic fibrosis is partly
due to maximal inspiration against obstructed airways. This requires
abnormally negative intrathoracic pressures, increasing the pulmonary
capillary blood volume, and, thereby, increasing the Dsb.
