Recently, we found the cystic fibrosis mucociliary inhibitor in urine
from homozygotes and heterozygotes, but not from normals.  In recent
studies we have attempted to compare the relative concentrations of
CFMI in material from homozygotes and heterozygotes.  The unites of
inhibition which reflect the concentration of the CFMI in serum and
tissue culture medium fractions from heterozygotes is close to
one-half of that in fractions from homozygous sources.  With
purification of the CFMI and the generation of a monospecific
antibody preparation, answers will become available to the questions
of whether or not there is a normal counterpart to the CFMI and
whether or not quantitation of the CFMI will be useful in
heterozygote detection and prenatal diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.
