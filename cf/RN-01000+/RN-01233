REVIEW.

"Psychosocial" literature on cystic fibrosis (CF) is critically
reviewed.  Major methodological shortcomings include the anecdotal
nature of findings, overemphasis on negative consequences of the
disease, and the lack of a suitable theoretical framework.  Avenues
for future research are suggested.
