Progress in screening.

CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: pc.

CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: di.  HUMAN.  INFANT-NEWBORN.  MASS-SCREENING.

Since the Dresden Meeting in 1977 there have only been a few new
developments of interest in special field of screening for cystic
fibrosis.  There is no ideal screening test for CF available today.
The BM Test Meconium is the test most widely used now but many
technical, psychological and methodological problems remain to be
solved before the test can be endorsed without reservation.
