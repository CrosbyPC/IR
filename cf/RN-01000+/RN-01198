Altered polyamine metabolism in cystic fibrosis.

CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: ur.  POLYAMINES: ur.

ADULT.  CHILD.  CHILD-PRESCHOOL.  CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: bl.  FEMALE.
HETEROZYGOTE.  HUMAN.  MALE.  PUTRESCINE: ur.  SPERMIDINE: ad, bl, ur.
SPERMINE: ur.

Children with cystic fibrosis excreted elevated urinary levels of all
three polyamines--putrescine, spermidine, and spermine. Heterozygote
parents excreted intermediate concentrations of the polyamines, but
not levels significantly different from levels in normal controls.
Patients with cystic fibrosis who were administered a tracer amount
of [14C]spermidine excreted 11--13% of the radiolabel within 72 hr
whereas normal controls excreted 60--76% of the radiolabel within 72
hr. Spermine excretion was positively correlated with increased
pathology as assessed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
clinical score, whereas urinary putrescine and spermidine levels were
negatively correlated with increased pathology.
