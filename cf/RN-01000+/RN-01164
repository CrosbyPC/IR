In our efforts to standardize the evaluation of bronchial reactivity
we performed investigations into the threshold dosage of
acetylcholine-induced bronchospasm in patients with various recurrent
and chronic bronchopulmonary diseases.  A significantly decreased
threshold value of acetylcholine and thus an increased bronchial
reactivity could be proven in patients with cystic fibrosis in
comparison with healthy children.  The cause of bronchial
hyperreactivity in patients with CF may be due to proteases deriving
from leucocytes of the purulent sputum.  Furthermore, we investigated
the influence of terbutaline on the bronchial obstruction induced by
acetylcholine in patients with bronchial asthma and cystic fibrosis.
The groups were comparable, especially with regard to the degree of
the initial bronchial obstruction.
