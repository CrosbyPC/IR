One of the symptoms of cystic fibrosis (mucoviscidosis) is pancreatic
insufficiency.  The reduced proteolytic activity in the gut of
children with the disease results in an elevated concentration of
protein, especially serum albumin, in the meconium.  This feature is
used in the diagnosis of the disease in the newborn, and we decided
to examine the utility of enzyme immunoassay for the measurement of
albumin in meconium samples from normal and cystic fibrosis infants.
Normal samples were found to have apparent albumin concentrations in
the range 0.05-0.26 mg/g dry wt., whereas cystic fibrosis samples had
concentrations in the range 60-230 mg/g dry wt.  The assay provides a
cheap and relatively rapid method of differentiating cystic fibrosis
positive and negative meconium samples.
