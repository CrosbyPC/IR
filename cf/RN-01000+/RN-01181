The present investigation was designed to assess the absorption and
disposition in cystic fibrosis patients of two commonly used
antibiotics: an aminopenicillin, epicillin, and a cephalexin,
Ospexin.  The pharmacokinetic parameters of epicillin in patients
with CF and their normal controls differ in a number of aspects.  The
difference found in the maximal plasma concentrations could be
accounted for by a manifold increase in the renal clearance of the
drug.  Our data support the idea that patients with CF exhibit an
unusually large and rapid renal clearance of certain penicillins.
