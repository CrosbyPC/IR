Ten years ago, we demonstrated that chronic administration of
isoproterenol to rats results is structural and functional changes of
their salivary glands similar to those seen in exocrine glands of
patients with cystic fibrosis.  Recently, we began to study the
cellular pathophysiology of these glands and managed to achieve
pharmacological control of this abnormality.  We demonstrated that
administration of a beta-adrenergic antagonist in these animals
resulted in the correction of the electrolyte abnormality which is
very similar to that seen in the sweat glands of patients with cystic
fibrosis.  These two examples of manipulation of the secretory
processes in exocrine glands of experimental animals demonstrate the
feasibility of this approach in the therapy of patients with cystic
fibrosis.
