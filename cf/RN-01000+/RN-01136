Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated significant
differences in the extent of protease reactivity with MUGB
(4-methylumbelliferyl guanidinobenzoate, a sensitive active site
titrant of many serine proteases) when plasma and cultivated skin
fibroblasts from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), obligate
heterozygotes, and controls were compared.  Because of these
observations, and the potential value of amniotic fluid for the
prenatal detection of cystic fibrosis, these studies were extended to
human amniotic fluid obtained by amniocentesis done for the
intrauterine detection of genetic and other fetal abnormalities.  An
amniotic-fluid sample obtained from a woman who was subsequently
delivered of a baby with CF showed a much reduced level of MUGB
reactivity similar to the relative deficiency observed in plasma and
cultivated skin fibroblasts from patients with CF.  These
observations suggest that amniotic-fluid protease activity may be a
useful marker for the prenatal detection of CF.
