This paper presents additional evidence of the variability and
independence of the involvement of the sweat glands in cystic
fibrosis.  A case report of an infant girl, who died at age 9 years
of progressive pulmonary disease, is presented.  The case indicates
that fatal cystic fibrosis, or a variant thereof, can exist with
normal levels of sweat chloride and that the pulmonary disease
develops independently of the functional abnormality of the sweat
glands.
