An annotated catalog of clinical and pathologic observations in an
adult population with CF has been presented. The spectrum of disease
is broad, and the diagnosis usually requires the demonstration of
abnormalities in multiple systems. Tissues of each germ layer have
been found involved in CF. Correlation of clinical and pathologic
observations suggests that manifestations are essentially episodic
and focal. In this population, the most characteristic abnormalities
recognized by the pathologist are focal biliary cirrhosis,
distinctive obstructive lesions of the male genital tract, prolonged
staphylococcal or pseudomonas colonization of respiratory secretions,
and obstructive bronchopulmonary disease. Some form of pancreatic
atrophy is usually present.
