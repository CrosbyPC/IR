Hosli has published a hypothesis relating to the primary cause of
cystic fibrosis (CF) based on his observations that the level of
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in CF-derived skin fibroblasts, but not
fibroblasts derived from normal individuals, could be increased
several-fold by growing the cells in the presence of the urinary
glycoprotein, Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP).  However, we have not been
able to show, in Adelaide, any change or induction in the level of
ALP activity in CF-derived skin fibroblasts when grown in the
presence of locally prepared THP under what appear to be identical
cell culture conditions to those used by Hosli.  It thus appears that
under the conditions currently employed in our laboratory, there is
no diagnostic discrimination between fibroblasts of CF homozygotes
and normal individuals.
