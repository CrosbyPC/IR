Reliability of sweat test in cystic fibrosis [letter].

CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: di.  SWEAT: an.

CHLORIDES: an.  FALSE-POSITIVE-REACTIONS.  HUMAN.  SODIUM: an.

The report by Huff, Huang, and Arey again calls attention to the
heterogeneity of cystic fibrosis and to the fact that a properly
performed sweat test in the normal or borderline range does not rule
out cystic fibrosis.  This may occur in approximately 1% of patients
we classify as having cystic fibrosis and confirms our original
impression that the sweat test has a reliability of between 98% and
99%.  One must pay close attention to the clinical picture, the
family history, and especially the pulmonary or gastrointestinal
findings, and provide rational treatment until more acceptable
evidence of the disease can be documented.  In the same issue is a
report on a false positive sweat test in a Canadian patient with the
Mauriac syndrome.  The authors list a variety of conditions that have
been reported as yielding elevated sweat electrolytes.  The manner of
the collections can greatly influence the result. - In patients with
transient abnormal sweat electrolytes, sodium values were
consistently higher than chloride values.  Perhaps the finding of
sodium values in excess of chloride in the abnormal range suggests a
false positive test.
