This paper presents preliminary results from metabolic balance
studies of iron, zinc and manganese absorption and retention in
children with cystic fibrosis and Shwachman's syndrome.
Malabsorption of zinc, iron and manganese in exocrine pancreatic
insufficiency has been demonstrated by these early studies.  A
possible relationship between this and the associated features of CF
has been briefly discussed, and indicates areas for further research.
If such relationships are established then some form of trace element
supplementation should be considered.
