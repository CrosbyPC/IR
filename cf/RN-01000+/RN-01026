Cystic Fibrosis (CF) serum and its isolated component IgG fraction
produce an increased uptake of 45Ca++ in rabbit tracheal explants
when compared to control serum and its isolated IgG fraction.
Heterozygote serum also produced an increased uptake of 45Ca++ but
not to the same extent as CF serum.  The calcium channel blocker
D600 inhibited the CF serum induced uptake of 45Ca++ indicating that
CF serum may be acting on the plasma membrane to produce changes in
calcium permeability in rabbit tracheal explants.
