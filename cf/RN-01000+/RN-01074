Quantitative and functional assessments were made of both the
classical and alternative pathways of complement activation in sera
from 23 patients with cystic fibrosis. The classical pathway
functioned similarly in patients and controls as measured by CH50
titre. Alternative pathway function, initiated in patient sera by
incubation with inulin, was equal to that of controls as determined
by cleavage of Factor B and C3, and by the consumption of terminal
components. Factor B, however, was more readily activated in patient
than in control sera. This rapid alteration of Factor B did not lead
to accelerated or more extensive activation of the terminal
complement components via the alternative pathway when assessed by C3
cleavage and the consumption of terminal components. Thus, a
complement deficiency was not found. The importance of the easily
activated Factor B is undefined.
