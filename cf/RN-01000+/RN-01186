Making the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis requires clinical suspicion
and sweat tests.  Physicians today are aware of the main clinical
features of pulmonary and pancreatic involvement and are suspecting
the diagnosis earlier than in past years.  The accuracy of the sweat
test is the most crucial factor in confirming the diagnosis.  The
present case illustrates this point.  The main purpose of this paper
is to serve as a reminder that the sweat test is often less than
accurate as frequently performed.  The principal pitfall of sweat
testing at present seems to be the use of a chloride electrode
applied to the skin without assurance that an adequate amount of
sweat is present.
