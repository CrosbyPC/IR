The major issue is not the "lack of interest of clinical chemists,"
but the actual performance of the test.  Neither the pathologist nor
the clinical chemist, in all likelihood, actually performs the test.
Rather, it is the medical technologist or technician who carries out
the actual procedure.  It is a major part of our roles as educators
and laboratory administrators to ensure that these people are
adequately trained for the task and that the test meets high enough
performance standards to provide a clinically relevant answer.
