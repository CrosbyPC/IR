Detection of cystic fibrosis protein by isoelectric focusing of
serum [letter].

HUMAN.

Several cystic fibrosis research groups have independently attempted
to reproduce the isoelectric focusing work of Wilson et al.  The
protocol that we employed with the LKB Mulitphor electrofocusing
apparatus was that of Wilson et al., although fixing and staining of
the polyacrylamide gels was performed in a boiling water bath for 30
min.  In 10 of 11 sera from patients with CF, the cystic fibrosis
protein band was directly identified by each of two independent
observers and in the sera from nine obligate heterozygote
individuals, the CFP band was noted in seven and eight instances by
each observer, respectively.  In sera from 26 normal control
individuals, the CFP band was observed in two instances.  Our results
would support the view that the CFP band is indeed directly
identifiable in both CT heterozygote and homozygote sera without
recourse to photographic image enhancement and that its frequency of
occurrence is similar to that reported previously.
