Studies are presented on the serum level of several acid glycosidases
in normal and cystic fibrosis subjects.  Levels of alpha-glucosidase
found in serum from CF patients were significantly higher than from
normals and heterozygotes.  The increase in alpha-glucosidase was
directly related to the clinical gravity of the disease.  Levels of
all other glycosidases studied in CF patients were in the normal
range.
