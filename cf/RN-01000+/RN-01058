Young adults with cystic fibrosis in good to excellent condition have
reduced plasma sodium and chloride and elevated plasma potassium
compared to a group of healthy young adult control subjects. Blood
pressure was also lower in the patients with cystic fibrosis.
However, plasma norepinephrine and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase and
their response to standing and isometric hand grip were normal in the
cystic fibrosis patients.
