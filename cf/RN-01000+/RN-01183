Diagnosing cystic fibrosis in adults [letter].

CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: di.

ADULT.  AGE-FACTORS.  ELECTROLYTES: an.  HUMAN.  SWEAT: an.

Gordeuk et al. state that cystic fibrosis may be first diagnosed in
adulthood, but we feel that a condition with such grave genetic and
prognostic implications must be diagnosed with special caution in
this age group.  In particular, the sweat test, which is the main
diagnostic tool for use with children, must be interpreted in adults
in the light of possible age-related increases in normal
sweat-electrolyte concentration and other factors that may affect the
assay.  Although it is generally accepted that "normal" sweat sodium
and chloride concentrations are higher in adults than in children,
there is no clear agreement about the upper limits of the normal
range in adults.  The volume of sweat produced during the test may
also have a substantial effect on electrolyte values.  For the
diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in adults, an attempt should thus be
made to base the diagnosis not only on "elevated" sweat-electrolyte
values and clinical impression but also on pancreatic-function data.
