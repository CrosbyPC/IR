Steatorrhea is a prevalent gastrointestinal manifestation of cystic
fibrosis.  Although deficiencies of vitamins A, E, and K have been
described in patients with this disease, vitamin D deficiency and
rickets have rarely been reported.  The major form of vitamin D,
cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), is produced by ultraviolet irradiation
of 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin.  Ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) is
a product of plant ergosterol.  We studied the vitamin D status of
patients with cystic fibrosis by measurement of the serum
concentrations of the major circulating metabolites of vitamin D:
25-hydroxyvitamin D and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.  The mean serum
concentrations of total 25OHD, 25OHD3, and 24,25(OH)2D and
25OHD3/25OHD ratios in patients with cystic fibrosis were similar to
values recorded in control subjects.  The present study demonstrates
that the serum concentrations of the major metabolites of vitamin D
in patients with cystic fibrosis are similar to those in healthy
subjects.
