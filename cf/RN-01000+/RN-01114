Sickle cell anemia and cystic fibrosis are the most frequent lethal
inherited diseases in the black and white population, respectively.
The occurrence of both diseases in the same individual has not been
reported in the literature.  This report presents two such patients
and poses questions concerning the possible clinical implications of
the simultaneous occurrence of both diseases.
