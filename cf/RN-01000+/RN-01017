An episode of severe small intestinal hemorrhage occurred in a cystic
fibrosis patient having pancreatic insufficiency and receiving timed-
release aspirin therapy for disabling hypertrophic pulmonary
osteoarthropathy. The increased acidity of small intestinal contents
due to decreased bicarbonate secretion observed in patients with
pancreatic insufficiency may alter the luminal environment and result
in mucosal erosions and/or ulcerations in association with the
presence of aspirin. Thus, physicians should be aware of the
possibility that timed-release aspirin causes small intestinal
hemorrhage in such patients.
