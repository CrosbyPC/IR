The aim of the present study is to reassess the peripheral pattern of
thyroid function in subjects with cystic fibrosis with special
reference to their responsiveness to thyrotropin-releasing hormone
(TRH) stimulation.  In all the CF patients the basal levels of serum
T4, T3, and TBG were within the normal range.  Mean values in CF
patients and in control children were not significantly different.
In CF patients there is no correlation between the TSH response area
and the basal level of serum T4, or with grading according to
Shwachman and Kulczycki.  We found no relation with therapy.  In
basal conditions, our data show a completely normal pattern of the
serum concentration of T4, T3, TBG and TSH in subjects with CF in
absence of iodide therapy.  Thyroid status should be examined in
patients with CF specially when they receive iodide therapy or other
drugs which can enhance the impairment of thyroid function.
