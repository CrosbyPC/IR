Forty-four patients with cystic fibrosis, sixty-seven parents, and
thirty-nine controls were compared with regard to their immediate
cutaneous hypersensitivity, total and specific serum IgE and serum
IgG4 concentrations. The patients had increased prick test reactions
and specific IgE to Aspergillus fumigatus. The development of
reactions to A. fumigatus correlated with the severity of the
disease. There were no other significant differences when serum total
IgE, specific IgE and IgG4 concentrations or skin test reactivity
were compared in the patients, parents and controls.
