The aim of this paper is to report in detail the clinical and
pathological observations in a case of cystic fibrosis showing widely
disseminated intravascular sickling.  To the best of our knowledge no
case of cystic fibrosis associated with sickle cell trait has been
reported in the literature.  A six month old infant who was diagnosed
to have cystic fibrosis and sickle cell trait was presented and the
literature was reviewed for this coexistence.
