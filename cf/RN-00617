CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: fg.  GENE-FREQUENCY.  HUMAN.  SELECTION-GENETICS.

When a genic disorder is only manifest if there are offending
alleles at both loci, as in fibrocystic disease, there is a loss of
two abnormal alleles with each affected birth since the homozygotes
rarely reproduce.  How is this loss compensated?  How could some
50,000 alleles, which can only survive to convey themselves in
effective gametes if they have a normal allelic partner, become
established in the British Isles - and how have some half a million
or more got into the world currency?  First, migrations and
settlements involve the proportion of defective alleles at all loci
being conserved, but their variety being increased.  Secondly, there
could be a general tendency due to some advantage in health or
vitality, which could be manifest by disease resistance, cold
resistance, and by any number of physical or psychological
mechanisms.  Thirdly, there may be 'compensation' - that is the
death of an infant may lead to replacement as a result of which the
replacing sib, if surviving, would have a 2/3 chance of being a
carrier.  Fourthly, the disease may be maintained by mutation.  Of
the four possibilities, three are unrealistic, so that substantial
selective advantage of heterozygotes over the last few hundred years
must be postulated.
