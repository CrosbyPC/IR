This brief review emphasizes the paradox of cystic fibrosis.  A
plethora of abnormalities have been disclosed yet none can be
accorded the pride of place as the primary inherited abnormality.
It is nevertheless hoped that in the near future, as a result of
collaboration and integration of highly specialized areas of
research, meaningful and significant data can be obtained which will
ultimately be of value not only in identifying heterozygotes with
this condition but also in the handling and treatment of patients
with this common and disabling inherited disease.
