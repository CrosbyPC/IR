Purified preparations of plasma alpha 2-macroglobulin from patients
with cystic fibrosis are shown to have normal amounts of total hexose
but as much as 40% decrease in their sialic acid content. The binding
of these preparations to concanavalin A and wheat-germ agglutinin was
markedly reduced as compared to normal values in controls.
Intermediate values were found in obligate heterozygotes. These
results suggest a possible alteration in the carbohydrate moiety of
alpha 2-macroglobulin in cystic fibrosis, presumably due to a
defective posttranslational process.
