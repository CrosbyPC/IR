Screening for cystic fibrosis in the newborn.

In an 8-year period, a programme of screening for cystic fibrosis has
been conducted over an extensive part of Wales.  The screening method
used is based on the detection of a high level of albumen (greater
than 20 mg%) in the meconium.  During the course of the
investigations several different tests have been used.  Because of
the high incidence of false-negative results (34%) the detection of
protein in meconium is not an ideal screening test, but is the most
satisfactory presently available, in the newborn period.  Because of
its relative simplicity, low cost, absence of direct involvement of
the parent or patient, and a high yield of positive cases, its use on
a wider scale may be justified.
