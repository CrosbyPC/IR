It is widely recognized that immunoglobulins, as the carriers of
antibody activity, play an important role in the defense of the
individual against infections.  The known cases of kappa or lambda
light chain type immunoglobulin deficiencies are heterogenous with
regard to clinical and immunological findings.  There are also a
number of similarities which may suggest common underlying factors.
The accurate investigation of additional patients, if available,
should provide more insight into the basis of kappa or lambda type
immunoglobulin deficiencies.
