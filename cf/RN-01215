Essential fatty acid supplementation with oral safflower oil (1
gm/kg/day) to 11 cystic fibrosis patients (aged 6 months to 14 years)
for one year produced no significant change in sweat chloride
concentration (mEq/liter) or sweat rate (gm/min/m2), Addition of
vitamin E (10 mg/kg/day) to the safflower oil had no effect on sweat
chloride concentration or rate compared to placebo. No clinical
improvement could be detected compared to a control group. These
results do not support previous reports of the effects of fatty acid
supplementation on sweat electrolyte concentrations in cystic
fibrosis.
