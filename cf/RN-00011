The prevalence of respiratory allergies and their effects on the
course of cystic fibrosis (CF) were studied in 63 patients.  Fifteen
patients (24%) had respiratory allergies as defined by history,
physical examination, positive allergy skin tests, nasal and
peripheral eosinophilia, and reversible airway obstruction.  Serum
immunoglobulins on these 15 allergic CF and 22 nonallergic CF
patients were elevated when compared with those in normal age-matched
controls.  The allergic CF patients had significantly higher IgE
levels (mean 598 international units [IU] compared to 281 IU); IgG,
IgM, and IgA levels were similar in the two CF groups.  The clinical
condition of the allergic CF patients, (Shwachman score) was better
than the nonallergic, suggesting some modulating effect of
respiratory allergy on the severity of the disease.
