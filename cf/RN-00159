Tobramycin treatment of chronic pulmonary infections caused by
Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 13 children with cystic fibrosis was
evaluated.  Initially the patients received the recommended dose
of 125 mg/m2/24 hours; the dose was then increased to 250 mg/m2/24
hours (approximately 10 mg/kg/24 hours).  This higher dosage was
administered intramuscularly to 9 patients.  Eight of these
received additional therapy with an aerosol containing tobramycin.
With this therapy it was possible to eradicate Ps. aeruginosa from
the respiratory tract in 5 of the patients.  After discontinuing
therapy Ps. aeruginosa re-occurred in all patients within one month.
All patients showed a clinical improvement in relation to therapy.
No toxic or allergic side effects were observed.
