Fatty-acid composition of serum-lecithins in cystic-fibrosis
patients without steatorrhoea [letter].

We have investigated the fatty-acid composition of serum-lecithins
from four groups of C.F. patients, defined by their pancreatic
function evaluated by 72-h quantitative stool fat and determination
of the coefficient of fat absorption.  C.F. patients without
pancreatic insufficiency and not on pancreatic extract had
significantly higher percentages of linoleic acid than did patients
of any other group.  The altered fatty-acid composition of
serum-lipid fractions seems to be a secondary consequence of the
pancreatic insufficiency commonly associated with C.F. disease and
not a direct metabolic defect as some have suggested.
