Abnormalities of Hageman factor dependent pathways have been
described in a wide variety of human disease states. Congenital
deficiencies of factor XII (Hageman trait) prekallikrein (Fletcher
trait) and high molecular weight kininogen (Williams, Fitzgerald and
Flaujeac traits) although resulting in profound in vitro changes, do
not cause in vivo difficulties. In contrast, deficiency of C1
esterase inhibitor (hereditary angioedema) results in significant
morbidity and mortality. Acquired diseases may exhibit decreased
synthesis of these three proteins in cirrhosis and dengue fever. In
vivo activation of factor XII initiated pathways occur in septic
shock, disseminated or localized intravascular coagulation, typhoid
fever, polycythemia vera, hyperbetalipoproteinemia, coronary artery
disease, nephrotic syndrome, transfusion reactions, hemodialysis and
extracorporeal bypass. Activation of both the intrinsic system and
tissue mediators contribute to the vasomotor phenomena in carcinoid
syndrome and postgastrectomy dumping. Roles for factor XII,
prekallikrein and kininogen have been suggested in gouty arthritis,
allergic disorders and cystic fibrosis but the evidence is not yet
convincing in these disorders.
