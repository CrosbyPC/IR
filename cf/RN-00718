Thymidine-requiring Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus

In the past year we have isolated thy- Staphylococcus aureus from the
sputum of four children with cystic fibrosis who were receiving
co-trimoxazole, and lately we have isolated a thy- strain of
Haemophilus influenzae from a patient with cystic fibrosis also
receiving co-trimoxazole.  In view of the exacting growth
requirements of H. influenzae we feel that thy- strains might easily
be overlooked or assumed to have died when they fail to grow on
sensitivity-test media.
