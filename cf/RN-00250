Twenty-six patients with cystic fibrosis all exhibited disease of the
paranasal sinuses, consisting of opacification of the maxillary
sinuses either alone or as part of a parasinusitis.  Symptoms of
sinusitis seldom occurred and treatment was not generally required.
Agenesis or delayed development of frontal sinuses was also seen in
the majority of patients.  Nasal polyps occurred in 27% of the
patients, all of whom were over five years of age.  Excluding those
patients under five years of age, none of whom had polyps, the
incidence was 36%.  In general, polyps were not observed in those
patients with severe disease.  Mild degrees of conductive hearing
loss were noted in the younger age groups especially, but no
instance of severe hearing loss or nerve conduction disturbance was
encountered.  Such mild degrees of hearing loss may merely reflect
the application of standards too stringent for this age group.
Throat and nose cultures on 26 patients revealed pseudomonas
aeruginosa in eighteen cases, reflecting the flora of the
tracheobronchial tree.  Other organisms were encountered on an
unpredictable basis with findings consistent with those anticipated
in this age group of patients.
