Many conditions have been reported to cause vocal cord paralysis.
To our knowledge cystic fibrosis has not been described as one of
these conditions.  A 15-year-old white male with cystic fibrosis,
who has been treated at our hospital, reported hoarseness of two
week's duration on a routine clinic visit in March, 1973.  In March,
1974, mirror laryngoscopy revealed a paralysis of the left vocal
cord in the paramedian position, consistent with paralysis of the
left recurrent laryngeal nerve.  It is felt that the vocal cord
paralysis in this patient with cystic fibrosis is due to compression
of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve by an enlarged pulmonary artery.
