Use of bland aerosols, particularly mist tents, in the treatment of
lower respiratory disease was reviewed and no convincing evidence of
efficacy was found.  This is not surprising because there is
evidence that mist tents deposit little water in the lower
respiratory tract.  Mist tents may be detrimental, in some cases,
because of bacterial contamination and because they can cause
bronchospasm.
