From 1971 to 1973, we hospitalized 41 symptomatic patients with
cystic fibrosis for intensive pulmonary therapy.  The more severely
ill patients were admitted more than once during this period.  Our
study included 100 courses of such intensive treatment.  Garamycin
pediatric injectable, containing 10 mg/ml of the active ingredient,
was administered intravenously to all patients in divided doses of
3.0 to 5.0 mg/kg/day.  The purpose of the study was to evaluate the
tolerance, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of garamycin when
administered parenterally to cystic fibrosis patients with serious
infections.  During the 100 courses of treatment, clinical
improvement was rated as follows: significant or definite
improvement, 39; moderate improvement, 50; slight improvement, 9; and
no change, 2.  The use of garamycin pediatric injectable is safe and
can be helpful in the management of the pulmonary infectious
complications of cystic fibrosis when employed along with other
well-established modalities of therapy.
