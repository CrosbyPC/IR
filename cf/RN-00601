Childhood hepatic steatosis is a commonly and generally benign
reaction that occurs in many pathophysiologic states.  Steatosis
can result from the following mechanism(s): impaired TGC clearance;
increased hepatic lipogenesis; decreased FA oxidation; and increased
lipolysis.  Cystic fibrosis  and syndromes producing pancreatic
insufficiency (pancreatitis) result in a variable degree of
steatosis most probably dependent on the nutritional and hormonal
state of the patient.  Patients with cystic fibrosis have impaired
glucagon and insulin release which alters their fat metabolism.  The
treatment of hepatic steatosis is aimed at the primary cause.
