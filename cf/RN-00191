Assays of carboxypeptidase B-like activity and C3 in serum from
patients with cystic fibrosis and appropriate control subjects failed
to demonstrate a deficiency of carboxypeptidase B-like activity or a
consistent increase in C3, as was suggested by Conover and
associates. Differences between men and women with cystic fibrosis
were apparent, in that women with cystic fibrosis had higher
concentrations of both serum carboxypeptidase B-like activity and C3
than either men with cystic fibrosis or control subjects.
