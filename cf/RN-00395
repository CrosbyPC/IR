We wish to report three cases of hyponatraemic dehydration in
children with cystic fibrosis admitted to this hospital in late June
and early July this year.  These three children with cystic fibrosis
clearly illustrate the danger of the present unusual climatic
conditions.  The necessity of salt supplementation in these
environmental circumstances should be emphasised to all concerned
and, above all, to parents.  The danger of the administration of
salt-free glucose solutions also should be borne in mind.  In the
past the case has been argued for a safe electrolyte solution that
would be commercially available.  In the absence of such a readily
available form of electrolyte-glucose solution parents will need
explicit instructions on how the salt supplement should be
administered.
