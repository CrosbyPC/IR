The isoenzyme pattern of alpha-L-fucosidase was studied by
isoelectric focusing in livers from seven patients with cystic
fibrosis and in normal and pathological (GM1-gangliosidosis, Type II
and Sanfilippo disease) controls. The controls had very reproducible
patterns consisting of seven isoenzymes of alpha-L-fucosidase with
the most neutral from (I) representing a small proportion of the
total activity. All seven of the cystic fibrosis livers had altered
alpha-L-fucosidase isoenzyme patterns. The chemical relationship of
the seven isoenzymes of normal liver alpha-L-fucosidase was
investigated using neuramindase. The five most acidic forms of alpha-
L-fucosidase appear to be related to the most neutral form by sialic
acid residues. Since the isoenzymes of liver alpha-L-fucosidase
appear to be related by sialic acid residues, it is possible that the
altered alpha-L-fucosidase isoenzyme patterns found in cystic
fibrosis livers may result from aberrant sialylation.
