HUMAN.

Culture medium from fibroblasts of cystic fibrosis patients and
controls was examined for the ability to inhibit (calcium plus
magnesium)-activated ATPase and (sodium plus potassium)-activated
ATPase. The ATPase systems used were both a solubilised preparation
from dog-fish and a membrane associated preparation from human
erythrocyes. Contrary to other reports the medium from cystic
fibrosis fibroblasts did not inhibit ATPase activity.
