Lung function studies using 13Nitrogen have been used to determine
regional and total lung function in 16 children suspected of having
localized lung disease amenable to surgery. This method is simple,
requires no active co-operation on the part of the child and gives a
radiation dosage of about one-third of that for a bronchogram. The
studies provided information about the severity and localization of
the disease, and in addition, information about the remaining lung
areas.
