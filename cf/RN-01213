Ten children with CF in matched pairs were infused with either
Intralipid or with 10% glucose on a double blind basis every other
week for one year. Although statistically there was significantly
greater gain in height and weight in the study year compared to the
previous year only for the test group, both groups improved more than
expected. Cumulative data analysis showed greater improvement for the
Intralipid group (23 of a possible 45 points) compared to the glucose
group (-2 points; P less than .02). This study indicates the need to
better define the role of nutrition in the pathophysiology of CF.
Meanwhile, it is recommended that all children with CF have plasma
linoleic acid levels measured at least once yearly, and if levels are
low, appropriate supplements should be given.
