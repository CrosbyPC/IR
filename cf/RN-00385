Peliosis hepatis, which has previously only been reported in adults,
occurred in a chronically ill 11-year-old boy with cystic fibrosis.
As in cases in adults, chronic illness, long-term anabolic steroid
therapy, and right ventricular congestive failure may well have been
the causative factors in this case. Histologically, the phlebectatic
and parenchymal types, which were presumed to be separate, were found
conjointly in this case. This is compatible with its origin from
severe right ventricular congestive failure. The rarity of peliosis,
however, indicates that one or more as yet unknown factors might be
operative in its development.
