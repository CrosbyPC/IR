This review is concerned with the disturbances in bile flow that
occur early in life.  Although cholestasis is defined
physiologically, it can be considered to have morphological features.
Morphological cholestasis is the presence of bile pigments in
histopathological sections of the liver and is most easily recognized
as bile plugs or thrombi in bile canaliculi.  Physiological
cholestasis, a reduction in bile flow, is inferred from the finding
of an elevated serum bile acid.  This inference is derived from the
known positive correlation between canalicular bile flow and bile
acid excretion that has been found to occur in all species this far
examined, including man.  An increase in the amount of bile acid in
plasma implies a reduction in the hepatic transport of the primary
conjugated bile acids of man and therefore a decrease in associated
canalicular bile flow.  Classifications of cholestatic syndromes,
functional abnormalities, and therapy for cholestasis syndromes are
discussed.
