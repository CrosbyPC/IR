A 21-year-old woman with a history of chronic lung disease secondary
to cystic fibrosis (CF) developed an acute hemorrhagic retinopathy
during exposure to moderately high altitude. Although retinal
hemorrhages are known to occur in patients with CF, we speculate that
the retinopathy in this case was partially related to altitudinal
change and that patients with chronic hypoxemia may be predisposed to
high-altitude retinopathy at much lower altitudes.
