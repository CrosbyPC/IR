Cystic fibrosis: demonstration of an abnormality in
mucopolysaccharides in cultured lymphoid lines.

CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: me.  LYMPH: me.

CELLS-CULTURED.  HETEROZYGOTE.  HOMOZYGOTE.  HUMAN.
LIPOCHONDRODYSTROPHY: me.  MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDES.
RETINITIS-PIGMENTOSA: me.  SYNDROME.

Cultured lymphoid cells of both homozygotes and heterozygotes for
cystic fibrosis could be distinguished from those of normals by (1)
growth pattern, gross clumping, and (2) a relative increase in
dermatan sulfate, with a normal total mucopolysaccharide content.
Lines derived from the genetic mucopolysaccharidoses also had these
characteristics, but their total mucopolysaccharide content was
markedly increased.  These observations support the hypothesis that
the cellular disturbance in cystic fibrosis resides in those
cellular regions whose functions would be altered by
mucopolysaccharide composition.
