The purpose of the investigation was to elucidate the variation of
the isoenzymes of human amylase in health and disease as well as
physico-chemical differences between individual isoamylases.  In
cystic fibrosis determination of serum isoamylase is of value,
although absence of pancreatic serum isoamylase is a normal finding
during the first year of life.  Demonstrable pancreatic serum
isoamylase in such early life argues against the diagnosis.  After
one year of age the test has a positive diagnostic value.
