This paper is a report on the first part of a comprehensive research
programme.  The aim is the development of a mechanical aid which will
enable patients with cystic fibrosis to give themselves satisfactory
physiotherapy.  The percussor, which can be used by patients, parents
or relatives, is portable and lightweight.  The domiciliary trial
showed that effective percussion could be self-administered to the
front of the chest and to a lesser extent to the sides of the chest.
The percussor was found to be very acceptable to adolescent patients
and especially girls with early breast development.  Further research
work has now been completed and as a result a system has been
developed which enables patients to treat themselves with
satisfactory chest percussion in the five preferred positions of
postural drainage.
