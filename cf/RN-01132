We have studied serum-angiotensin-converting-enzyme (SACE) in
sarcoidosis and other granulomatous disorders.  We have measured SACE
in 10 randomly chosen, consecutive patients with chronic
granulomatous disease (CGD) and in some of their family members and
in 5 children with cystic fibrosis and severe chronic pulmonary
involvement.  SACE levels in the patient with CGD differed
significantly from those of normal controls and those of family
members and patients with cystic fibrosis.  Our preliminary studies
show that CGD is associated with increased levels of SACE.
