The flexible bronchoscope with Fogarty balloon and irrigating
catheters is used effectively to manage and treat hemoptysis in a
series of patients with cystic fibrosis.  This procedure is well
suited to such patients, who are prone to recurrent hemoptysis, and
may also be indicated in any inoperable patient with poor
cardiopulmonary reserve.
