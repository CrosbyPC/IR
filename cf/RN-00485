The article by Dr Warner and colleagues may be of great significance
to our understanding of the aetiology and pathogenesis of cystic
fibrosis (C.F.), and accords with our observations that allergic
symptoms and positive skin tests are more common in C.F. homozygotes
than in healthy controls.  Apart from the fact that 59% of our C.F.
homozygotes gave a positive skin test to one or more of 40 different
classes of Bencard antigens, the main one being Aspergillus
fumigatus, at least 85% of the C.F. heterozygotes had a strong
positive history of allergy, of which the mother and her maternal
progenitors, followed by the siblings, accounted for most.  Further
studies are required to establish the relationship, if any, between
the gene responsible for the allergic manifestation in the population
and the C.F. phenotype.
