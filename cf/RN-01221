A procedure is described which permits the rapid isolation of large
amounts of elastase and cathepsin G from purulent sputum. This
procedure involves: (1) digestion of sputum with DNase, (2)
extraction of the insoluble residue that remains with 1 M NaCl, pH 8,
(3) affinity chromatography on Sepharose-bound Trasylol, and (4)
separation of the two enzymes by chromatogrphy on CM-Sephadex.
Starting with 500 g of sputum it was possible to isolate 175 mg of
each of these two enzymes within 7 to 10 days. Active site titration
indicated both enzymes to be at least 97% pure. Disc gel
electrophoresis in the presence and absence of SDS and amino acid
sequence of the N-terminal region support the conclusion that the
elastase and cathepsin G isolated from sputum are identical to the
same enzymes isolated directly from the leukocytes of human blood.
