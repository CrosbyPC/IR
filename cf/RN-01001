Turner and associates cited cystic fibrosis as an example of the
application of the judicious use of genetic counseling and prenatal
diagnosis.  The reader who is unfamiliar with genetic disorders,
prenatal diagnosis, and genetic counseling may have taken the "cystic
fibrosis example" as fact rather than a model, as intended.  Cystic
fibrosis is a recessive disorder for which prenatal diagnosis and
heterozygote detection are not yet possible.  Currently, because of
the present inability to detect the heterozygous state, genetic
counseling of individuals with a family history of cystic fibrosis
frequently means a statistical prediction is given, rather than a
precise recurrence risk.
