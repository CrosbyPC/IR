The expression of the gene coding for the cystic fibrosis ciliary
inhibitor has been examined in somatic cell hybrid clonal lines.
Hybrids were produced by the fusion of cultured skin fibroblasts from
cystic fibrosis patients with mouse RAG and LM (TK-) cell lines. The
ciliary inhibitor was detected by the oyster ciliary assay in several
primary hybrid clones but not detected in others, indicating the
segregation of an associated nuclear gene.
