There are many causes of respiratory distress staring more than one
week after birth in infants who have had no, or only transient and
minor, respiratory problems immediately after birth.  They may be
divided into two broad groups: those with primary pulmonary
pathology and those with extrapulmonary pathology with secondary
effects on lung expansion.  The former category includes
Wilson-Mikity syndrome, chylothorax and congenital pulmonary
lymphangiectasia, congenital lobar emphysema, cystic fibrosis,
hystiocytosis X, and acute infections.  The second group includes
congenital heart disease, foregut duplication, tracheo-oesophageal
fistula, diaphragmatic hernia, and asphyxiating thoracic dysplasia.
