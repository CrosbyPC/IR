In this study, we will report on a high number of black cystic
fibrosis patients in Brooklyn, New York, with a description of these
patients and the population of the area in which they reside.  A
total of 70 cases of cystic fibrosis were followed at the Long
Island College Hospital.  Ten, 14.2 per cent, of the 70 cases of
cystic fibrosis are black.  These are equally divided into 5 females
and 5 males.
