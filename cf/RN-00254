In certain cases of obscure chronic lung disease, the possibility of
a genetic disorder, such as cystic fibrosis of the pancreas, should
be considered. When the genetic defect fails to cause pancreatic
involvement, the partial expression of cystic fibrosis is
encountered. Elevation of sweat electrolyte levels is not sufficient
to confirm the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in adults since normal
levels vary widely in both adolescents and adults. Other tests
should, therefore, be utilized. The cilia dyskinesis test is positive
in both homozygous and heterozygous patients with cystic fibrosis.
Utilization of this technique in a family study confirmed the
diagnosis of partial expression of cystic fibrosis in an adolescent
female.
