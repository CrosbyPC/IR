Mucociliary clearance.

COUGH.  HUMAN.

Mucociliary clearance data obtained by our group in relatively
healthy cystic fibrosis subjects was not affected by cough.  The
majority of subjects mentioned in the original article did not cough
during the study and indeed were chosen because they were relatively
healthy at the time.  It was possible to study them over fairly long
periods without interference from cough and thus the relatively
normal clearance times demonstrated were presumably due to
mucociliary transport.  Reference was made to nasal mucociliary
clearance studies in patients with cystic fibrosis and normal
subjects which indicated that clearance was similar in both groups
until mild inflammation of the nasal mucosa was produced.  We would
like to point out that the work was performed in our Laboratory,
since no reference was given in the discussion.
