Cellular glycosaminoglycans in lymphocytes from patients with cystic
fibrosis.

Cellular glycosaminoglycans were isolated from lymphocytes from
patients with cystic fibrosis and controls. The isolated
glycosaminoglycans were fractionated by cellulose acetate
electrophoresis, analyzed for glucosamine and galactosamine content,
and subjected to hydrolysis with bovine testicular hyaluronidase. The
total glycosaminoglycan content, the per cent glucosamine and
galactosamine, and the distribution of cellular glycosaminoglycans in
circulating lymphocytes in cystic fibrosis were no different from
controls.
