Pneumothorax occurs in 2% to 4% of patients with cystic fibrosis
following rupture of subpleural blebs into the pleural space.  Death
can occur, and recurrences have been reported.  Therapeutic
procedures include needle aspiration, closed thoracotomy drainage,
open thoracotomy with pleural scarification, or intrapleural
instillation of irritants.  When injected into the pleural space, the
antimalarial drug quinacrine hydrochloride evokes an inflammatory
response; the resultant fibrosis produces a tight adherence of the
visceral and pleural surfaces.  Quinacrine therapy for pneumothorax
has been frequently used in adults, but there are few pediatric case
reports.
