Total body opacification is the phenomenon whereby introduction of
iodinated contrast material into the blood stream renders structures
differentially radiopaque according to their blood supply.  The term
implies the physiology: it is the whole body which is opacified, in
proportion to the iodine in its plasma and extravascular
extracellular fluid at the time of the radiograph.  To the density
inherent in the tissue before injection is added the opacity of the
iodine circulating through and transuding into it.  Just as tissues,
even those of "water density," have minor intrinsic differences in
x-ray absorption, so they may also have minor differences in blood
flow and transudation into the extracellular fluid; the combination
of these minor differences often makes the invisible visible.
