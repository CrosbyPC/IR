Studies were performed to demonstrate possibly cystic fibrosis-
related inhibition of mucociliary clearance in man. Topical
application of normal serum or of CF serum did not inhibit in vivo
nasal MCC. Induction of local inflammation by topical anti-IgE-
reduced nasal MCC in CF subjects, but increased MCC in normal
individuals. Furthermore, nasal MCC was inhibited in normal patients
by CF serum but not normal serum, applied to the anti-IgE-treated
nasal mucosa. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis
that CF serum inhibits MCC in vivo in the inflamed mucosa.
