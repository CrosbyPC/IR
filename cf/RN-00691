Our laboratory has reported abnormal polyamine levels in extracted
whole blood from individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF).  Since an
abnormality in putrescine uptake in CF fibroblasts would imply a
direct relationship to the genetic lesion, we initiated studies to
confirm and possible extend this observation.  There is no
significant increase in the Vmax of CF fibroblasts as compared to
values obtained for control cells.  We conclude that with our growth
and assay conditions, in which we attempted to duplicate those
described in the original investigation, there is no consistent or
significant increase in the Vmax of putrescine uptake in CF
fibroblasts.
