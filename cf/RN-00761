Respiratory infections in infants and children cause much ill-health
and also an appreciable mortality.  They are found at times in most
school-children and in infants, especially those in large families
and those living in poor circumstances.  In all respiratory
infections the whole respiratory tract is involved.  For descriptive
purposes it is useful to divide these infections into upper
respiratory-tract infections, in which the infection is
predominantly at the larynx or above; and lower respiratory-tract
infections, in which the predominant infection is below the larynx.
Acute upper respiratory-tract infections are usually viral and the
poly-virus infection of coryza is the commonest.  Acute lower
respiratory-tract infections are discussed in two groups: in infants
under two years of age and in children over two (including cystic
fibrosis).
