In spite of the widespread clinical impression that pulmonary
physical therapy, including breathing exercises, is helpful in the
pediatric age group, objective demonstration of the value of the
various maneuvers is for the most part lacking.  There is evidence
that the volume of sputum produced over short periods of time in
patients with cystic fibrosis is increased when cough is accompanied
by postural drainage and pulmonary physical therapy, but the
long-term effect of the various maneuvers on the course of the
chronic pulmonary disease remains unknown.
