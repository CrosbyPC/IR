We suggest that the intrauterine detection of cystic fibrosis may be
based on the investigation of the amniotic fluid.  It is known that
the protein content of the meconium of homozygotic newborn infants
is significantly increased, whereas that of heterozygotic infants is
only moderately increased.  As a result of intrauterine intestinal
activity, the bowel content may be excreted into the amniotic fluid;
thus a detectable deviation in the protein content of amniotic fluid
may be expected.  We decided to determine the total protein content
and the amount of acid-soluble glycoproteins in 86 amniotic fluid
samples, both by polography and by measuring the hexose content.  In
the homozygous case a slight increase was observed in total protein
content, whereas in the heterozygous cases no changes were observed.
