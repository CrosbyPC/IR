Clinical and radiological findings, quantified by special scores, in
36 patients with cystic fibrosis are compared with lung function
measurements, including the ratio of RV/TLC and FEV/VC and the
arterial blood gases at rest and during exercise. Although
respiratory function tests were found to correlate well with both the
pulmonary finding score and the chest radiographic score, distinction
of three severity groups was possible only by a vector calculation of
the blood gases in PaO2-PaCO2-diagram, at rest and during exercise.
Thus, measurements of pO2 and pCO2 at rest and on exercise appear to
be a helpful adjuvant to routine spirometry for the individual
appraisal of the degree of lung involvement, performance and care
level.
