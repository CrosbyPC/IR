An outbreak of salmonellosis in patients consuming pancreatin in the
U.K. prompted a study at this hospital which included determination
of the infecting dose in children with cystic fibrosis known to have
contracted a S. schwarzengrund enteritis from contaminated porcine
powdered pancreatin.  We found that infection was especially
prevalent in very young cystic-fibrosis patients who were receiving
broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment for chest infection.  All had
their pancreatin added to meals immediately before consumption.
Susceptibility to most infections depends on many factors and
variables.  It is necessary to take into account such things as age
and condition of the patient when discussing the actual number of
organisms causing an infection.
