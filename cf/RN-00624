Putrescine transport was examined in normal and cystic fibrosis
fibroblasts. No differences were observed in accumulation pattern,
kinetics of uptake, or efflux between CF and normal cells. In both
growing and growth-arrested CF and normal fibroblasts, exogenously
supplied putrescine remained unchanged for at least 60 min. Some
differences were observed in the response of CF and normal cells to
environmental (media) changes.
