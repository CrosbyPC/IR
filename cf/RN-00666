The use of electron microscopy as a further method of diagnosis of
disease in cultured skin fibroblasts and cultured amniotic fluid
fibroblasts is presented. It was demonstrated that Tay-Sachs disease,
Fabry's disease, and metachromatic leukodystrophy had distinctive
abnormalities in both cultured skin fibroblasts and cultured amniotic
fluid fibroblasts. It was shown that control of culturing conditions
made it possible to distinguish normal cell lines from certain cell
lines carrying known genetic diseases.
