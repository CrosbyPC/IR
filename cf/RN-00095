Twelve patients with abdominal complaints had an operation that
included incidental appendectomy.  They were later diagnosed as
having cystic fibrosis.  Four groups of presenting signs and symptoms
were right lower quadrant mass, chronic abdominal pain, intestinal
obstruction, and hepatomegaly.  In all cases the symptoms
precipitating operation were due to the underlying unrecognized
condition: cystic fibrosis.  Review of the histology of the appendix
revealed the classic changes of hypersecretion of the mucous glands
to be present.  The appendix shares in the generalized intestinal
mucous gland involvement peculiar to cystic fibrosis.  Awareness of
this fact has not been widespread, perhaps because of the usual
emphasis on the pulmonary and pancreatic aspects of the disease.
Greater appreciation of the clinical symptoms of cystic fibrosis and
more liberal use of the sweat test could have diminished the number
of exploratory celiotomies.  Recognition of the histoloc changes in
the removed appendices can also suggest the proper diagnosis and lead
to earlier institution of treatment with an improved prognosis.
