Albumin in meconium was quantitated by means of a single radial
immunodiffusion technique, which is described in detail.  The method
shows good precision and accuracy for this material, when certain
conditions associated with collection, preparation, and analysis are
observed.  The method can discriminate between healthy newborns and
newborns with cystic fibrosis.
