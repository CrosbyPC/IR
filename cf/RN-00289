Samuels and Elliott have described a new technique for detecting
cystic fibrosis (C.F.) and the heterozygote for C.F.  We have tested
this technique in detail on a smaller number of patients.  Although
the number of samples tested in our study is small, results suggest
that this technique is not likely to be successful in detection of
heterozygotes for C.F.
