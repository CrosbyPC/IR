This article reports a case of a 22-year-old unmarried black woman
with cystic fibrosis.  There is only one report in the literature of
cystic fibrosis in a black person over 20 years old.  Due in part to
the deficiency of pancreatic exocrine secretions and the production
of a copious amount of highly viscous mucus by gastrointestinal
glands, patients with cystic fibrosis are prone to recurrent
intestinal obstruction, intussusception, and volvulus, as well as
abdominal pain and masses.  Shwachman and Holsclaw firmly state that
the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis may be made on the histologic
appearance of the appendix.
