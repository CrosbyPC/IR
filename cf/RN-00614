Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with viral lower respiratory tract
illnesses (LRI) had depressed levels of the third and fourth
components of complement, which returned to normal after recovery.
There was no clinical evidence of immune complex disease. CF patients
with LRI and no virus isolates, CF patients in stable status, and non-
CF patients with LRI did not have complement depression. It is
postulated that antigen-antibody complex activation of complement may
occur in CF patients with viral LRI.
