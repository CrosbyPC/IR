It would seem that early diagnosis of cystic fibrosis and the
institution of an aggressive treatment program before widespread
irreversible lung damage has occurred may greatly prolong survival.
Individual prediction at the time of diagnosis is impossible, but
there are a number of factors which, when considered together, enable
the clinician to place patients in a number of broadly defined risk
groups.  It is the definition and characteristics of these groups
which would help the physician in assessment, counseling, and
follow-up of patients with cystic fibrosis which are addressed in
this article.  The heterogeneity of cystic fibrosis, sex differences,
presentation and age at diagnosis, pulmonary function, radiologic
assessment, and projections for the future are discussed.
