A new method, radio-crossed immunoelectrophoresis, demonstrates alpha-
fetoprotein (AFP) in sera with a sensitivity of 1 mug/1. By this
method AFP with alpha mobility was not found in sera from healthy
individuals, patients with chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis,
primary biliary cirrhosis, secondary liver cancer and cystic
fibrosis. In some of the sera, AFP was elevated when measured by
conventional radioimmunoassay method and the sera contained an AFP-
like substance with gamma mobility when analyzed by radio-crossed
immunoelectrophoresis. The nature of this gamma substance is still
obscure and needs further investigation.
