Calcium phosphate, which precipitates in submandibular saliva of
patients with cystic fibrosis because of elevated calcium
concentrations, was shown by electron microscopy to transform, on
standing in vitro, from amorphous calcium phosphate globules to
stellar clusters of hydroxyapatite crystals.  Amorphous globules
appeared to form at regular nucleation points on a fine network of
unknown nature.  Hydroxyapatite crystal formation was confirmed by
electron diffraction pattern and chemical solubility.
Zymogen-granule spherules (inclusion bodies), which are present in
greatly increased numbers in cystic fibrosis submandibular saliva,
disintegrated on standing from a homogeneous appearance to beaded,
hollow spheres.
