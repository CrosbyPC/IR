Sera from juvenile diabetic and nondiabetic controls were tested,
using the immunoperoxidase method, for the presence of islet-binding
immunoglobulins. All diabetic sera tested contained an islet-binding
protein and on the average the sera were more positive than age-
matched controls. Normal adult sera are undifferentiated from
juvenile diabetic sera. Most sera from children less than two years
of age did not bind to islet tissue and sera from cystic fibrosis
patients had a markedly diminished ability to bind to islet tissue.
The binding protein appears to be an immunoglobulin which selectively
reacts with elements of the islet beta cell.
