Although constipation is not well defined, when it is brought to the
attention of a physician, it should raise certain questions.  In a
newborn, is obstipation due to Hirschsprung's disease, meconium
ileus, or intermittent volvulus?  Is obstipation in a child with a
mass in the cecum due to cystic fibrosis - i.e., meconium ileus
equivalent?  Has the formula been mixed correctly?  Does the patient
have spinal defects?  Has the child been on medications?  Is the
child constipated for psychogenic reasons?  All of us who deal with
children should consider all of these entities in each of our
patients, so as not to miss those several diseases with grave but
preventable consequences.
