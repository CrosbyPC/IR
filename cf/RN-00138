No differences were found in the methylation of total nucleic acids,
total RNA, DNA, tRNA, or rRNA from lymphocytes or fibroblasts
obtained from normal subjects, obligate heterozygotes, or
individuals with cystic fibrosis.  Similar results were obtained
using four methods for isolation of the nucleic acids.  The reasons
for the failure of two laboratories to discern the reported
variations in methylation of RNA in the normal, carrier, or cystic
fibrosis state may be obscure differences in culture conditions or
conditions of extraction.
