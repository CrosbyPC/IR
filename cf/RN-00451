The present communication reports the effect of the bacterial mucus
on the activity of antibodies on strains of P. aeruginosa.  Mucoid
variants of P. aeruginosa obtained from the non-mucoid strains PAO
381 and PAT 404 by selection for phenotypic resistance to the
virulent phage E 79 were more resistant to carbenicillin than the
non-mucoid parent strains.  Mucoid P. aeruginosa strains isolated
from two CF patients were more resistant to carbenicillin than
non-mucoid strains isolated from the same samples of sputum.  When
the experiments already described were repeated with oxytetracycline,
in contrast to our experience with carbenicillin, mucoid strains were
found to be more sensitive than non-mucoid strains.  To prove the
hypothesis that mucoid strains can be selected in vivo by
carbenicillin therapy it will be necessary to show that the level of
carbenicillin in CF secretions is less than the minimum inhibitory
concentrations of mucoid strains but greater than that of non-mucoid
strains.  We are now investigating additional CF isolates in
conjunction with the range of antibiotics used in chemotherapy of CF
patients.
