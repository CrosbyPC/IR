Cystic fibrosis in an infant presenting with metabolic alkalosis.

We recently had an opportunity to study a four-month-old boy with
failure to thrive, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis, high serum
aldosterone values, and who was found to have cystic fibrosis.
Children with cystic fibrosis have moderately elevated plasma renin
and secondarily elevated serum aldosterone value.  This is due to
chronic sodium chloride loss through sweat.  Our patient had high
serum aldosterone values associated with only slightly elevated
serum cortisol value.  High  serum aldosterone value increased
further despite correcting conditions which stimulate aldosterone
secretion.  This suggests that long-standing salt depletion is not
the only cause for abnormal renin-aldosterone system.
