The total activity and isoelectric focusing patterns of arginine
esterase, cathepsin B1, and several lysosomal hydrolases were normal
in liver from two patients with cystic fibrosis. No abnormalities
were observed in values for pH optimum, Km, and Vmax for arginine
esterase and cathepsin B1 in liver from cystic fibrosis patients
compared to those values for liver from the control subject. Soybean
trypsin inhibitor at concentrations up to 100 microgram/ml had no
effect on liver arginine esterase or cathepsin B1.
