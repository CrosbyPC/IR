It has been reported that saliva and serum of patients contain
macromolecular "factors" which are presumably cationic and inhibit
transport of electrolytes, induce dyskinesis or degranulate
sensitized polymorphonuclear leukocytes and contain polypeptide
moieties.  The difference between levels of trypsin-like activity of
mixed saliva of patients with cystic fibrosis and controls has been
confirmed.  A number of studies have been carried out in order to
determine if a deficiency of proteolytic activity might account for
the presence of cystic fibrosis serum factors.  It was presumed that
the observed partial deficiency of arginine esterase activity might
well represent the total deficiency of one of several arginine
esterases assayed under the experimental conditions.  Although it was
postulated that the deficiency of arginine esterase activity is
related to the elevation of the levels of polypeptide or protein
"factors", the hydrolysis of peptide bands by activated plasma could
not be demonstrated, probably due to the limitations of the methods
employed.  The deficiency of plasma arginine esterase in cystic
fibrosis has been questioned and confirmed in another laboratory.
