Cystic fibrosis is a disease in which there are enormous and
sometimes overwhelming psychological and social problems encountered
by the patient and his family.  The present "state of the art" as it
pertains to the psychological and social aspects of cystic fibrosis
are examined.  Attitudes towards cystic fibrosis, implications of a
genetic diagnosis, heterozygote screening, and projections for the
future are discussed.
