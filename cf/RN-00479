Two adult patients with cystic fibrosis had late onset of symptoms
with principal involvement only of the lungs. The absence of other
typical features of cystic fibrosis confused the diagnosis. Recovery
of mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa from sputum cultures helped to
establish the diagnosis in these patients, because these mucoid
isolates are rarely obtained from subjects who do not have cystic
fibrosis. Recent findings, which have identified the mucoid isolates
as predominantly a single strain of P aeruginosa and have documented
its widespread carriage in the United States by patients with cystic
fibrosis, point to an interesting epidemiologic relationship between
this bacterium and this disease.
