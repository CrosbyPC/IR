Three adult patients with cystic fibrosis presented with arthralgia,
and investigation for the usual causes of arthritis proved negative.
Radiographs of long bones revealed periostitis and new bone fromation
characteristic of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy. Symptomatic
improvement occurred after analgesic and anti-inflammatory therapy.
In patients with cystic fibrosis and bone or joint pain, the
diagnosis of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy should be considered and
long bone radiographs obtained.
