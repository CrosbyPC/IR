Chronic illness at any age is unfortunate.  It taxes the strengths
and resources of the individual and those associated with him.  The
chronically ill teenager faces difficulties different from those of
the child or adult.  Illness itself is a burden to the adolescent;
chronic illness is an even greater burden.  The tasks of maturation
which must be successfully completed in adolescence are made more
difficult by chronic ill health.  Impact upon the patient,
educational needs, sexuality needs, life expectancy, impact upon the
family, and impact upon society are examined.  Specific illnesses,
such as diabetes mellitus and fibrocystic disease, are discussed.
