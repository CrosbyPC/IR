Many types of lung disease are seen in the pediatric age group.
These range all the way from disorders of the neonate that are
closely related to parturition, to acute infectious diseases seen in
infancy and early childhood, to chronic disorders such as cystic
fibrosis and bronchial asthma.  Management of the conditions
described involves cooperation between the primary care physician and
the specialist.  A variety of organizations offers aid to both
physicians and patients' families.
