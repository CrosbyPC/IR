The intractable diarrhoea syndrome of infancy continues to be a major
diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to the paediatrician and
paediatric gastroenterologist. A carefully organized, staged approach
to diagnosis will provide the best method of identifying those
infants in whom a specific aetiology exists and for whom specific
therapy is often available. Regardless of aetiology, however, the
early use of appropriate nutritional support will not only reduce
morbidity and mortality in these infants, but will prevent the
development of many of the secondary consequences of malnutrition.
The physician must compulsively pay attention to the details of daily
management and provide an organized approach to diagnosis and
treatment in order to improve the outcome of infants with intractable
diarrhoea.
