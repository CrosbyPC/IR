The fundamental pathological observations in cystic fibrosis (CF)
were made over three decades ago.  More recently, physiological
findings have directed investigation toward a plethora of humoral
substances and their possible role in disturbances of the secretory
processes in CF.  The application of the techniques of molecular
biology and of tissue culture is beginning to increase our knowledge
about the so-called CF factors and their diverse effects on
epithelial and ciliated surfaces.  Emphasis in current research is
on the chemical characterization of the CF factors, the metabolism
of cells cultured from patients with CF, and the biochemical events
controlling the processes of secretion.  Some current theories as to
the metabolic pathogenesis of CF are considered in the context of
existing findings.
