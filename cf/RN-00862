Protease activity, assayed using 4-
methylumbelliferylguanidinobenzoate, an active site titrant of
certain proteases, is significantly deficient in plasma of patients
with cystic fibrosis. The deficiency can be demonstrated with both
chloroform-ellagic acid activated plasma in which the proteases can
hydrolyze esters of arginine and unactivated plasma in which the
proteases have negligible activity towards these esters. The
deficiency can also be demonstrated by separation of the proteases by
isoelectric focusing on polyacrylamide gels or by chromatography on
agarose columsn. Since protease deficiency can be demonstrated with
unactivated plasma, the deficiency in cystic fibrosis is probably due
to a reduced number of protease molecules rather than their decreased
catalytic efficiency.
