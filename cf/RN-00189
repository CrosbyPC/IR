A nurse and mother describes the clinical effects of cystic fibrosis
on patients and the long-term demands the disease places on her own
and other children and families.  Diagnosis is mainly accomplished
with an analysis of sweat for sodium and chloride ions.  CF is
transmitted as a Mendelian recessive trait.  It is a generalized
dysfunction of the endocrine glands.  The abnormalities, seemingly
unrelated, appear as loss of electrolytes through the sweat and
salivary glands and as unusually thick, sticky mucus secretions that
obstruct and damage the patient's pancreas, lungs, gallbladder,
intestines, and liver.  The objective of pulmonary therapy are to
decrease viscosity of the pulmonary secretions and to improve and
maintain pulmonary hygiene.  Financial cost is only one of many
burdens on the family.
