A simple immunochemical technique utilizing single radial
immunodiffusion for the demonstration of albumin in human meconium
is described.  A comparison of this technique with the more widely
used sulphosalicylic acid precipitation method is reported.  We also
have attempted to determine the normal levels of albumin in
meconium.
