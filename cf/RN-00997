We describe two infants with previously undiagnosed cystic fibrosis
who had electrolyte depletion, metabolic alkalosis, and dehydration
in the winter and three infants known to have CF in whom similar
manifestations developed.  We confirm previous reports that salt
depletion and metabolic alkalosis do occur throughout the year in the
northern United States and England.  When metabolic alkalosis and
hypoelectrolytemia in infancy are not explained on the basis of other
clinical conditions, CF should be suspected.  Pediatricians should
measure serum electrolyte values promptly and consider early
parenteral fluid and electrolyte therapy as a preventive measure for
infants with CF with persistent vomiting and/or diarrhea.
