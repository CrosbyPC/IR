High speed cinemicrographs are made on the ciliary activity of rabbit
tracheal cilia with the aid of Nomarski optics. The detailed nature
of the ciliary beat pattern is determined from slow motion analysis
of the high speed cinemicrographs (1-3). Such documented forms of
ciliary beat pattern and the physiologic state of the tracheal
epithelia are utilized as basic reference controls to investigate the
physiologic effects of cystic fibrosis serum on ciliated epithelia
and the cystic fibrosis tracheal mucus stagnation phenomenon. Careful
analyses of the high speed cinemicrographs reveal that cystic
fibrosis serum has no effect on the rhythm and beat pattern of rabbit
tracheal cilia. However, it is shown in controlled procedures that
cystic fibrosis serum has a cytolytic effect on the tracheal
epithelial cells and also at the cell junctions. Ciliary dyskinesis,
as described in previous reports (6-9), is actually a secondary
effect of cytolysis and cell destruction.
