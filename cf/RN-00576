The growth kinetics of human diploid skin fibroblasts derived from
cystic fibrosis (CF) homozygotes, CF heterozygotes and normal
individuals was determined. The population doubling times increased
with time in culture, and no difference was observed between the 3
genotypes tested. The cell cycle times remained constant through the
10th subculture, while the growth fraction, or fraction of cells in
the cell cycle, decreased with culture time; however, changes in the
growth fraction and population doubling time appear to be related to
cellular senescence in vitro rather than to cystic fibrosis.
