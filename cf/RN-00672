Because immediate hypersensitivity reactions can occur in individuals
exposed to powdered pancreatic extracts, 36 patients with cystic
fibrosis and 51 patents of such patients wwer studied for evidence of
sensitization. Sensitivity to the extracts as evidence by history and
skin testing was infrequent in the children with cystic fibrosis.
However, skin testing for immediate hypersensitivity with either
crude pancreatic extracts or inactivated trypsin correlated well in
their patents with a history of clinical symptoms. IgE mediation of
these reactions in sensitized individuals was demonstrated by antigen-
induced histamine release from leukocytes, passive transfer studies,
and immediate response to inhalation challenge.
