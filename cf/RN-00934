Long considered a childhood disease, cystic fibrosis has been
recognized with increasing frequency in adults.  In the case reported
below the diagnosis was made in an adult.  The initial diagnosis of
cystic fibrosis in patients over 30 years of age has rarely been
reported.  Our patient, in whom the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis was
first made at 48 years if age, serves to emphasize the point that
physicians should consider cystic fibrosis in the differential
diagnosis of adults with unexplained chronic obstructive lung
disease.
