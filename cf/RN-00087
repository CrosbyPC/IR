METHODS.

A method suitable for the study of regional lung function in
children is described.  The method is simple to perform, takes only
2 min, and provides pictorial and numerical information on regional
ventilation and perfusion and a scaling factor measured after
rebreathing to account for regional variation in lung size and
shielding.  Although the availability of a computer system such as
the one described in the text is essential for precise and rapid
numerical evaluation, nuclear medicine laboratories that lack this
facility but have a gamma camera could use this method to obtain
scintigraphic information alone.
