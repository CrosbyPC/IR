The effect on intracellular production of carbon dioxide from glucose
of sera from cystic fibrosis (C.F.) homozygotes and heterozygotes was
determined in an established cell line (Vero cell) by a double-blind
assay. CO2 production was reduced when cells were incubated with an
ammonium-sulphate-precipitated fraction of sera from C.F. homozygotes
and heterozygotes but not by a similar fraction from sera of healthy
donors.
