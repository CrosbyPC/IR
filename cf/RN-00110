In 1972 May, Herrick, and Thompson questioned the classical
hypothesis of cystic fibrosis (C.F.) and suggested that C.F.
children are in fact abnormally susceptible fo any respiratory
pathogen from birth.  It is perhaps a bit premature to change the
classical hypothesis for the bacteriology of C.F.  Since the
predominant flora of hospital nurseries is not now Staph. aureus
but rather gram-negative bacteria, it may be that the initial
exposure of C.F. patients is to an organism other than Staph.
aureus.  In addition, other organisms are becoming as resistant to
antibodies as Ps. aeruginosa, so other organisms could perhaps be
present in terminal sputum flora - which agrees with our data.
