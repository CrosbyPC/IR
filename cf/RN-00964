There is considerable dispute regarding the prevalence of asthma in
patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). We studied 50 patients with CF
and compared their responsiveness to inhaled histamine with that of
asthmatic children. The incidence of positive responses to inhaled
histamine was 24% in the patients with CF and more than 90% in the
asthmatic patients. We found no correlation, in the patients with CF,
between the histamine response and several indexes of atopy (clinical
allergic disease and positive allergen skin tests). Positive
responders to histamine were not evenly distributed over the disease
spectrum of CF. Instead, positive responses occurred only in those
patients whose prechallenge pulmonary function was abnormal. We
conclude that the heightened bronchial reactivity in patients with CF
reflects the severity of their underlying lung disease rather than
the presence of coexistent asthma.
