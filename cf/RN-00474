An infant explored for obstructive jaundice died 6 days
postoperatively and was found to have extensive infarction of the
common duct. This would have gone undetected had the patient survived
and without careful sampling at autopsy. The incidence of this
unsuspected complication is unknown. Surgical infarction may be one
cause of fibrosis and secondary atresia of the extra-hepatic bile
ducts.
