Immediate skin hypersensitivity to various inhalant allergens was
present in 59% of 123 children with cystic fibrosis (CF), a much
higher percentage than in the general population. This is consistent
with the idea that atopy arises as a result of impaired handling of
antigen at mucosal surfaces. The allergic CF children had more chest
infections, a worse chest x-ray appearance, and lower peak expiratory
flow rates. Allergic diseases were also frequent in the CF obligate
heterozygotes (32% of mothers and 26% of fathers). It is suggested
that the heterozygotes may also have a mucosal abnormality resulting
in defective antigen handling.
