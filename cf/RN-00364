The biliary tree of 66 patients with cystic fibrosis was examined by
conventional roentgenographic methods. Forty-five per cent of the
oral cholecystograms were judged abnormal by our criteria. A study
was considered abnormal if there was no visualization or if there was
visualization of a microgallbladder or structural abnormality
including marginal irregularities, septate gallbladder or
cholelithiasis. Intravenous cholangiography was used to further study
the 22 patients who did not visualize on the oral study. Again,
anatomic abnormalities were prevalent but six patients in this group
had normal appearing gallbladders. Abdominal pain, a frequent symptom
in cystic fibrosis, was not associated with roentgenographic
abnormality. No correlation was seen between the external biliary
tree abnormalities and multifocal biliary cirrhosis which was present
in 40% of these patients. Further, no correlation was seen between
serum gamma glutamyl transpeptidase levels and either of these
lesions.
