In this review, we make a deliberate attempt to put all the
information on vitamin E requirement, absorption, metabolism, and
function in both animals and man in better perspective.  The large
clinical trials in which vitamin E was given at pharmacological
levels for presumed medical indications, as well as trials of vitamin
E for bona fide deficiency disease in man, will be extensively
reviewed.  Nutritional aspects discussed include dietary intake,
biological activity, the evaluation of nutritional status, and the
relationship to dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids.  Metabolism
concerns include absorption, transport and deposition, and cellular
function.  Clinical aspects include deficiency states, approaches to
therapy, and possible pharmacological effects.
