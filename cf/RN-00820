In a group of 223 children with various chronic, non-specific
respiratory diseases, the levels of serum inhibitory proteolytic
enzymes in bronchial secretions was measured. Activity of inhibitory
proteolytic enzymes was analyzed according to the nature of bronchial
lesions observed at bronchoscopy and character and cellular
composition of bronchial secretion. Statistically significant
increase of the mean inhibitory value in comparison to values in the
control group, was found in children with recurrent bronchitis (a-1-
AT), cystic fibrosis (a-1-AT and a-1-X), chronic bronchitis (a-1-X),
bronchiectases (a-1-X) and in children with obstructive bronchitis (a-
2-M).
