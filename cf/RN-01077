In vitro lymphocyte responses to Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been
found to be impaired in cystic fibrosis patients with advanced
clinical disease. The responses to Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia
marcescens, and Proteus mirabilis were studied in a similar group of
cystic fibrosis patients and normal individuals. Cystic fibrosis
patients found to be unresponsive to pseudomonas were also
unresponsive to klebsiella, serratia, and proteus. Responsiveness to
Staphylococcus aureus was not impaired in cystic fibrosis patients.
We postulate that in vitro lymphocyte responses to several gram-
negative bacteria require the function of a lymphocyte subpopulation
which may be impaired in some cystic fibrosis patients.
