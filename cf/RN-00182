A patient with cystic fibrosis was found to have pneumatosis coli
associted with rectal prolapse.  In cystic fibrosis there are
several factors predisposing to pneumatosis, yet it is rarely
reported.  Symptoms are nonspecific, and the diagnosis should be
considered in patients with cystic fibrosis or other chronic lung
disease and vague abdominal complaints.
