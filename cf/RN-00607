As patients with cystic fibrosis survive longer, the number of
adults with this chronic obstructive lung disease is increasing
rapidly.  Chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis are similar in a
number of respects.  The treatment of cystic fibrosis and chronic
bronchitis has some similarities.  But chronic bronchitis and cystic
fibrosis also differ in many respects.  The pathogenesis of chronic
bronchitis is more clearly related to exogonous factors such as
smoking and air pollution than is cystic fibrosis, which is
genetically determined.  Clinical differences also exist.  Major
differences in treatment between cystic fibrosis and chronic
bronchitis are currently in vogue.  Because of the special problems
of adulthood, it is appropriate that many adult patients with cystic
fibrosis be cared for by internists who have previously focused
their attention on chronic bronchitis and emphysema.  Increased
communication between internists and pediatricians on the issue of
cystic fibrosis is badly needed today.
