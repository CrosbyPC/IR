Demonstration of a factor in the serum of homozygotes and
heterozygotes for cystic fibrosis by a non-biological technique.

A factor has been isolated from serum of homozygotes and obligate
heterozygotes for cystic fibrosis using isoelectric focusing and
disc electrophoresis as analytical methods.  The factor is focused
within an IgG-fraction with an isoelectric point of pH 8 to 9 but
differs from IgG in its lower molecular weight.  It is thus similar
to, if not identical with, the ciliary dyskinesia factor.
