Alpha-fetoprotein in serum and amniotic fluid in the diagnosis of
neonatal hepatitis syndrome, Indian childhood cirrhosis, cystic
fibrosis, ataxia telangiectasia and spina bifida.

Alpha-fetoprotein (A.F.P.) was detected and quantitated by the methods
of immunodiffusion in agarose, counterimmunoelectrophoresis and
radioimmunoassay.  Serum A.F.P. level was raised in patients and
siblings of Indian childhood cirrhosis, cystic fibrosis homozygotes
heterozygotes, neonatal hepatitis and ataxia telangiectasia.  It was
mildly elevated in biliary atresia.  In women with previous history
of a child with severe neural tube defect, raised amniotic fluid
levels of A.F.P. were associated with anencephaly or spina bifida.
The diagnostic utility of A.F.P. in pediatrics, especially in
genetic counselling, is discussed.
