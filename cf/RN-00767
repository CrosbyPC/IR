Has too much attention been focused on antibiotic therapy in cystic
fibrosis, thereby overshadowing other measures which have led to the
improved prognosis?  This may well be true and there is no doubt
that regular intensive physiotherapy, performed daily by the
patients' relatives, plays the major part in improving airway
obstruction.  More skilful nutritional management including adequate
pancreatic replacement therapy and high-energy, high-protein diets
will also have had beneficial effects on the respiratory defects.
The infected CF patient may not require high doses of antibiotics;
he too might benefit more from simple nutritional alterations.  It
is not new to suggest that nutritional factors are important
influences on the resistance to infection of the CF patient.  What
we can now do is measure the different aspects of the immune
response in such patients and those with malnutrition, so that the
simplest and most direct therapy can be chosen.
