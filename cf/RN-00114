Large molecules which consistently stimulate hypersecretion in
individual mucus-secretory sells in an animal system (the marine
invertebrate Sipunculus) have been found in human serum and urine.
This activity is heat-evoked in serum, heat-labile in urine.
Heat-stable and heat-evoked factors were also found respectively in
saliva and tears.  The serum and urine factors withstood
freeze-thawing.  Activity of both factors was destroyed by pronase,
and activity of the urine factor was destroyed by trypsin.  After
incubation with alphaamylase the factor in urine induced production
of a very aberrant type of secretion.
