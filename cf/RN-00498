Mucus is the primary aetiological factor in the development of
pulmonary disease in cystic fibrosis.  Biochemical studies on
bronchial secretions have not yet confirmed any qualitative
difference in composition or in the nature of the glycoproteins, the
major component of secretion.  With the lack of any clear evidence of
a basic abnormality in the nature of mucus, attention has been
directed to the possible defect in the control of mucus secretion.
This encompasses alteration in the normal regulation of the autonomic
nervous system or to its stimulation either at the cellular or
intracellular control level.  In recent years, attention has focused
on the presence of ciliotoxic factors in serum of children with
cystic fibrosis, and their possible role in the pathophysiology of
cystic fibrosis.  Control of mucus secretion, submucosal glands,
goblet cells, experimental models of lung disease in cystic fibrosis,
the role of serum factors in mucus secretion, and the mucus blanket
in chronic lung disease are discussed.
