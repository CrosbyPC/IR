Cystic fibrosis is the most common lethal genetic disease in
childhood, and the broad range of its clinical expression can involve
practically every specialty of medicine.  The pathology of cystic
fibrosis, its clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment are
discussed.  The pediatrician will not want to attempt to provide
exclusive care for the CF patient.  These patients require the many
supports that only a specialized center will have.  Chest surgeons,
pediatric surgeons, otolaryngologists, cardiologists,
gastroenterologists - in fact, all fields of medicine and all medical
specialties - may be needed for the various clinical problems
associated with the disease.
