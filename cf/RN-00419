The hypothesis by Doggett and Harrison, according to which alpha-
amylase is the pathogenic factor of the exocrinopathy in cystic
fibrosis (C.F.), is investigated.No elevation of alpha-amylase in
sweat and serum of C.F. patients, as compared with controls of
similar age, is observed. It is concluded that the "C.F. factor"
cannot be identified with alpha-amylase.
