A 5-month-old white girl was admitted to an Infant Intensive Care
Unit of Jackson Memorial Hospital.  According to her mother, the baby
had been in "her usual state of health" until one week before
admission, when she began to "spit up" after feedings and her lower
extremities became puffy.  Vomiting increased in frequency until it
occurred after every meal; eventually the baby refused all feedings;
there was no diarrhea.  Ultimately, the family's physician, when
consulted, recommended that she be admitted to the hospital.  On the
fourth day she developed renal failure with anuria and rising
creatinine concentration despite adequate fluid intake; peritoneal
dialysis was begun.  However, she soon became hypothermic and
developed pulmonary edema, and she died a few hours later.  A
discussion of the case is presented.
