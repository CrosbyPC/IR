Collecting sweat in patients with cystic fibrosis [letter].

CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: di.  SPECIMEN-HANDLING: mt.  SWEAT.

CHILD.  HUMAN.

Dr. Soldin describes a method of collecting sweat for the diagnosis
of cystic fibrosis which involves placing the patient on an electric
blanket and wrapping him warmly for 2 - 5 hours until profuse
sweating has occurred for 30 minutes.  One important omission from
the title and the abstract is any mention of safety.  Children with
cystic fibrosis may develop heat prostration when exposed to high
temperatures, which may cause massive sodium and chloride losses via
the sweat.  This could occur with the method described.  The
apparatus described by Gibson and Cooke in the classic pilocarpine
iontophoresis method of collecting sweat is neither overly
sophisticated nor expensive.  It remains the method of choice,
although attention to detail is important.
