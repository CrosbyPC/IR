The three patients described here have all been seen recently at the
Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh, and each has
presented a diagnostic problem.  In the three cases presented it has
been difficult to establish the true diagnosis.  In the first case,
symptoms compatible with the diagnostic criteria of Beumont and his
colleagues were directly the result of a slow-growing cerebral
neoplasm which was elusive to diagnose.  The second patient, a boy
with cystic fibrosis, showed symptoms strongly suggestive of
anorexia nervosa and responded to dietary measures without
pancreatic enzyme replacement.  We have been unable to demonstrate
any organic disease in the third case and, hence, a presumptive
diagnosis of anorexia nervosa has been made.  It remains to be said
that this condition is extremely rare in boys and that anorexia with
weight loss warrants extremely thorough investigation.
