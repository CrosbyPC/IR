The chloride electrode sweat test and gravimetric chloride titration
technic are compared. The two technics gave comparable mean values,
ogives, equivalent points, and overlap for patients with cystic
fibrosis and healthy subjects. As a single test with either technic
has an unacceptable risk for false-positive or false-negative
results, tests should always be done in pairs. A statistical
interpretation technic based on prevalence and technical variability
of the two tests will decrease the number of undiagnosed subjects and
will define probability of cystic fibrosis in the undiagnosed group.
