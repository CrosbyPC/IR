A ciliostatic factor has been isolated from cystic fibrosis (CF)
saliva by dialyzing it from purified alpha-amylase prepared by a
glycogen-complex method. This method of isolating the CF factor is an
improvement over the previously employed heparin procedure. The
activity of the isolated factor is proportional with concentration
using the oyster gill ciliostatic assay and in its inhibition of
mammalian glycogen debranching enzyme. The ciliostatic action of the
factor can be reversed by heparin under certain conditions. The type
of inhibition of the debranching enzyme by the isolated CF factor
indicates that its chemical structure is similar to that observed
with hydroxyalkylamines and polyamine metabolites. Physical
properties of the isolated factor indicate that it is of low
molecular weight and is labile as a function of pH and temperature.
At neutral pH the conditions under which it is maintained have a
direct effect on the length of time that it is stable.
