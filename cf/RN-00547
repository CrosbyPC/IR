It cannot be emphasized too strongly that all infants who wheeze do
not have asthma.  Because of the life-threatening consequences of
failure to detect some of the clinical entities that present with
wheezing, the clinician should thoroughly investigate the infant who
wheezes.  Cases illustrating some causes of wheezing, additional
causes of wheezing, and approaches to diagnosis are discussed.
