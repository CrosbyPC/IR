The patient was a 5-month-old white male admitted in coma via
transferral from another hospital.  Clinical discussion argues that
this child had acquired coagulopathy due to vitamin K deficiency and
that this was secondary to the fat malabsorption that occurs in
cystic fibrosis.  The left third nerve palsy and contralateral
hemiparesis in a patient with rapid neurologic deterioration suggest
a mass lesion in the left cerebral hemisphere with uncal herniation.
Pathologic discussion also suggests intracranial hemorrhage, massive
on left, accompanied by cystic fibrosis with severe pancreatic
lesions and bleeding disorder, probably due to vitamin K deficiency.
