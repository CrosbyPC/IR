In the Netherlands a retrospective study of the prevalence of cystic
fibrosis (CF) at birth has been performed by means of an inquiry set
up among 815 medical specialists (paediatricians, lung specialists
and pathologists) and by analysis of hospital admission data, death
certificates and data of the national CF foundation. The study was
confined to the years of birth 1961-1965. On a total of 1,239,566
live births 342 infants and children were found to have CF (1/3600).
A list of all studies on the frequency of CF in Caucasian populations
is presented as an appendix. A seasonal trend in the expression of
the CF gene at birth (either with or without meconium ileus) was
noted.
