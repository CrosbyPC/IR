Bone mineral content, bone width, and their ratio were measured in
patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) using monoenergetic photon
absorptiometry. Serial measurements of the radius and ulna were made
in 27 patients with CF and were compared with 968 age-matched
controls. Demineralization was found in 37% of the boys and 63% of
the girls. Patients under age 10 years had normal bone mineral
content and nine of 15 patients aged 13 or older were demineralized
(P less than .01). Demineralization correlated with the extent of
weight reduction in patients (P less than .001). Patients most likely
to be demineralized were adolescent girls. To our knowledge, this is
the first report of bone mineral status of children with CF, and the
results indicate that a sizable proportion of these patients may be
demineralized without overt rickets.
