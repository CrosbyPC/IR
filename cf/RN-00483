Two reviews have questioned the value of meconium tests for the
routine screening of cystic fibrosis because of the high proportion
of false-positive and (perhaps more importantly) false-negative
results.  We wish to report our findings on false-negative results.
We are evaluating various methods of meconium screening including the
Boehringer Mannheim test strip, a semiquantitative test for proteins,
electroimmunoassay of albumin, and estimation of the
albumin/alpha1-antirypsin ratio.  The figures are too small to draw
any conclusions between the apparent relationship of false-negative
results and a family history of the disease, but we feel that the
results illustrate that little reliance should be put on a negative
meconium test.  This is not to say that the meconium test is
valueless.  In our study, at least 40% of infants with cystic
fibrosis had a positive meconium-test result but did not have
meconium ileus and thus the possibility of cystic fibrosis in these
infants was recognised within a few days after birth and usually well
before definitive clinical signs of the disease were manifest.
