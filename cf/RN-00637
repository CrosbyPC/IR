The in-situ sweat test is prone to errors from various sources. This
paper examines errors due to evaporation, absorption of water into
the skin, and pressure of the electrode on the skin. Only evaporation
caused serious errors. The accuracy and precision when measuring
small chloride/sweat samples on the skin are not significantly worse
than when measuring bulk solutions.
