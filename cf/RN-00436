Determination of fibroblast proliferation rates and RNA methylation
patterns in our laboratory has revealed no alteration in cells from
cystic fibrosis patients.  Blood polyamines are located predominantly
in erythrocytes with low concentrations in plasma; sweat has likewise
been shown to have a low content of spermidine and spermine.  Whole
blood polyamine concentrations fluctuate from one individual to
another and are especially variable in females subject to the
hormonal changes of the menstrual cycle.  Because of the variability
in the spermidine and spermine content of blood, it is useful to
express such data on the basis of the spermidine/spermine ratio;
however, results must be analyzed according to sex and, in the case
of females, should be interpreted in relationship to the menstrual
cycle.  Spermidine/spermine ratios are significantly elevated in
whole blood extracts and isolated erythrocytes from male CF homo-
and heterozygotes.
