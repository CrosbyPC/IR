Bronchial artery embolization is a useful palliative treatment for
life-threatening haemoptyses where surgery is contra-indicated.
Patients presenting with haemoptyses complicating cystic fibrosis and
aspergilloma have been embolized. Control of haemoptysis was achieved
in the former, but late recurrence of haemoptysis in the latter led
to asphyxiation.
