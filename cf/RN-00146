The management of cystic fibrosis continues to present a constant
therapeutic problem to both pediatrician and internist.  In these
hospitalized patients, the use of a butterfly scalp vein needle
attached to a plastic tubing sealed by a rubber cap ("Heparin Lock")
offers many advantages.  This report relates our experience with
this method.  The use of an indwelling intravenous infusion set for
the home administration of potent antibiotics has been quite
successful in the therapy of the chronic bronchopulmonary infection
associated with cystic fibrosis.
