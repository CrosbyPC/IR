A noninvasive, radionuclide imaging technique for measuring the rate
of mucus clearance in the trachea (RT), was used to study
gravitational effects on mucus clearance in 13 patients with cystic
fibrosis (CF), average age 17 years; 7 normal, nonsmoking adults,
average age 26 years; and a normal subject who was recovering from an
acute upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). In the upright
position, nine of the CF patients and the subject with URTI
demonstrated abnormal tracheal mucus clearance which approached
normal when they were placed in 25 degrees headdown position. The
normal subjects and two of the CF patients showed no significant
difference in the RT measured in the two positions. The results of
the study indicate that the force of gravity can be a major influence
on tracheal mucus clearance in CF and URTI subjects. This conclusion
supports the use of postural drainage as an effective form of therapy
in patients with cystic fibrosis.
