Despite some critical debate lately about the usefulness of
physiotherapy in certain chest conditions, the fact remains that many
patients voluntarily undertake regular postural bronchial drainage to
help their sputum.  A substantial number also find rapid chest
percussion over affected lung segments useful in loosening the
sputum.  Chest percussion by a mechanical device controlled by the
patient himself seems worthy to trial.  Maxwell and Redmond have
compared a commercial device with manual percussion during postural
bronchial drainage.  The two techniques resulted in expectoration of
similar quantities of sputum, although all but one patient felt
subjectively that the machine delivered better-quality percussion.
Before parents and others are advised to buy percussing machines, we
need a formal study of postural drainage with and without chest
percussion.
