A child diagnosed as having cystic fibrosis by customary criteria has
been given regular parenteral soya oil emulsion from near birth.
Sweat tests have improved, pancreatic achylia was relieved, and the
child at present remains entirely well. Correction of the essential
fatty acid deficiency found in cystic fibrosis may prevent some of
the manifestations of the disease.
