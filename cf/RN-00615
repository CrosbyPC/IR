CASE-REPORT.  CHILD-PRESCHOOL.  HUMAN.  MALE.

We were interested in the case reported by Mukherji et al., which
suggested that cystic fibrosis might be an acid
mucopolysaccharidosis.  We have seen a similar child.  Aged 5 years
he was admitted to hospital with pneumonia.  In spite of conventional
treatment with cloxacillin and colistin he collapsed and died 48
hours after admission.  The heart was not enlarged, but the
myocardium showed a grossly abnormal appearance with variations in
thickness and extensive areas of firm pale tissue.  Histology of the
heart muscle showed very dramatic changes with severe replacement
fibrosis distributed patchily through the myocardium.  This similar
mixture of neutral and acid mucopolysaccharides was shown in both the
pancreas and the salivary glands.  There have now been a number of
reports of myocardial fibrosis complicating cystic fibrosis.  The
case reported by Mukherji et al. and this case are the first in which
mucopolysaccharide deposits have been found in the myocardium.  The
mixture of neutral and acid mucopolysaccharides in our case does not
support the hypothesis that cystic fibrosis is simply a genetic acid
mucopolysaccharidosis.
