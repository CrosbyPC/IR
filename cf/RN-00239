It is most important to deal with the feelings of the child and his
family in regard to cystic fibrosis.  Genuine recognition of feelings
by the pediatric staff can go a long way toward reassuring family
members that their long-standing burden and suffering are being
validated and understood.  When a family manifests early signs of
difficulty in coping with the emotional and physical stress imposed
by cystic fibrosis, it is helpful to refer them to a child
psychiatrist for consultation.  It is primarily the families at high
risk for breakdown which most require early prevention and
intervention.  The role of the pediatrician as the primary clinician
is crucial.  It is he who must provide the support and understanding
that are integral parts of the primary prevention of emotional
decompensation in this disorder.
