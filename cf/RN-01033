Cystic fibrosis is the commonest semilethal genetic disorder in
Caucasians.  The biochemical sequence that leads to widespread
dysfunction of exocrine glands has yet to be determined.  Cystic
fibrosis in adults has been the subject of extensive review.  We
still do not know the cause of the changes in the lungs.  Pancreatic
insufficiency was recorded in 95% of the patients, but the older ones
needed little dietary restriction and some seemed to thrive without
pancreatic replacement.  Ninety-five per cent of males have aspermia
due to failure of development of the vas deferens, epididymis, and
seminal vesicles.  Despite the obvious handicap and emotional and
social strains in all four series, adolescent and adult patients with
cystic fibrosis not only did well at school and at work but managed
to fit in well in their social framework.
