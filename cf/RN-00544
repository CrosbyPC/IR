Stimulated by Professor R. B. Elliott of Auckland,Australia, we have
administered Intralipid regularly to a small number of babies in the
last two years.  The volume used has been 10 ml of the 10% solution
per kilogram of body weight.  This volume is administered every three
weeks, the infusion taking approximately three hours.  The four
entrants in the trial are all doing well clinically.
