The nature of the metabolic defect in cystic fibrosis (C.F.) is
unknown.  We therefore undertook to study fatty-acid oxidation
(Beta-oxidation) in patients with C.F.  There was no significant
difference in the results obtained in controls and either affected
individuals or heterozygous carriers.  All the values in the
affected individuals lay within the normal range.  Unless for some
special reason the defect is not expressed in leukocytes, these
results indicate that the metabolic pathway involved in fatty-acid
oxidation (Beta-oxidation) is intact in C.F.  It therefore seems
unlikely that the reported deficiency of certain essential fatty
acids in C.F. is the result of a defect in fatty-acid metabolism.
