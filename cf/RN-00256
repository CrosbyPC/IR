Sulfated glycoproteins having blood group H activity were isolated
from the sputum of a child suffering from cystic fibrosis, by
reduction of the fibrillar mucus, chromatography on ECTEOLA-
cellulose, and gel filtration on Sepharose 4B. The sulfated
glycoproteins were degraded with alkaline borohydride, and the
degradation products were fractionated by chromatography on ion
exchange resins and by gel filtration. The carbohydrate chains thus
obtained have a wide heterogeneity with regard to acidity and
molecular size. The neutral chains contain blood group H active
oligosaccharides and incomplete chains as short as 1 residue of 2-
acetamido-2-deoxy-D-galactose. The minimal size of the neuraminic
acid-containing chains is less than that of the sulfated chains,
which increases with the degree of sulfation. The sulfate groups are
linked at C-6 at the D-galactose residues.
