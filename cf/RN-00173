By measuring potential difference between rectal mucosa and perianal
skin using a reference electrode placed on the forearm, we
demonstrated an altered potential difference in cystic children
compared with control adults and normal children.  We suggested this
might be due to an alteration in the rectal mucosa potential or
altered skin potential, or both, in cystic fibrosis.  We measured
skin and rectal charges directly by connecting our reference
electrode to the blood stream through an intravenous line.  Using
this technique we showed that the cystic fibrosis patients (C.F.)
have an abnormal perianal skin potential difference compared with
readings we obtained in normal children.  There was little
difference in the transmural rectal potential difference between our
cystic patients and previously reported values in normal adults.
Thus the recent paper confirms our findings of normal polarity of
the rectal mucosa surface and the increased skin polarisation in
cystic fibrosis.
