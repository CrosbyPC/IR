Size distribution of lymphocytes in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.

ARTHRITIS-JUVENILE-RHEUMATOID: bl.  LYMPHOCYTES: cy.

ASTHMA: bl.  CHILD-PRESCHOOL.  COMPARATIVE-STUDY.
CYSTIC-FIBROSIS:  bl.  HUMAN.

The diameters of circulating peripheral lymphocytes were measured in
28 children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. These were compared
with lymphocyte measurements in 68 normal children, 19 children with
asthma, and 12 children with cystic fibrosis. The average diameter of
lymphocytes in normal children was found to be 11.2 microns. In
contrast, the average diameter of lymphocytes in juvenile rheumatoid
arthritis was 12.7 microns (P less than 0.0001). There were more
lymphocytes with a diameter of 13 to 15 microns in children with
juvenile rheumatoid arthritis than in normal children.
