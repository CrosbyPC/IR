Patients with cystic fibrosis (C.F.) showed raised serum levels of
alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). A moderate but significant increase in serum
AFP was present in their parents and some siblings. There was no
correlation between the clinical severity of the disease and serum
AFP concentration. Samples from control groups with gluten-induced
malabsorption and bronchiectasis had normal levels. Persistent
synthesis of AFP may be an associated marker of C.F. genes, and
estimation of serum AFP might help in detecting heterozygote carriers
in families at risk.
