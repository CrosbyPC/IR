With improvement in the treatment of children suffering from cystic
fibrosis and increase in the average survival to about 17 years of
age, many more patients with this disease are now coming under the
care of thoracic physicians.  In nearly every patient,
broncho-pulmonary disease is the major problem.  Pneumothorax is
encountered in about 15% of the older patients and some of these
occur bilaterally.  A few patients develop refractory airways
obstruction and then a trial of steroids is justifiable.  Most
patients with cystic fibrosis also require treatment for their
pancreatic insufficiency.  Diabetes mellitus is more common in cystic
fibrosis than in the normal population.  Analysis of sweat is
essential for diagnosis.  The psychological stresses imposed upon
patients and their families are very great.
