Postmortem examination of a 26 week old (postmenstrual) human fetus
delivered by Cesarean section revealed meconium ileus and many
swollen mucus-secreting cells in the gastro-intestinal mucosa. The
pancreas showed extensive fibrosis, acinar destruction and dilatation
of ducts containing eosinophilic casts. Mucous glands of the lungs
also revealed mucous cells swollen and distended with their secretory
products. The patient is believed to have cystic fibrosis of the
pancreas, suggesting that the pathologic manifestations of the
disease may begin early in fetal life.
