Alpha-L-Fucosidase activity is elevated in skin fibroblasts from
cystic fibrosis patients when compared to controls.  The activities
of nine other acid hydrolases including neuraminidase are similar in
cystic fibrosis  and control fibroblasts.  The relationship of these
results to the recent finding of a decreased activity of
alpha-L-fucosidase in the serum of cystic fibrosis patients is
discussed.  It is proposed that an abnormal distribution of
alpha-L-fucosidase is involved in the pathogenesis of this disease.
