Patients with cystic fibrosis have tocopherol deficiency presumably
as a result of steatorrhoea.  Evidence for possible muscular
involvement in cystic fibrosis patients is clinical (muscular
weakness and wasting in many patients), biochemical (creatinuria on
a creatine-poor diet, with reversal of this finding after ingestion
of tocopherol esters, accompanied by a decrease in creatine in
plasma and an increase in creatine in muscle), and pathological
(focal lesions in skeletal muscle resembling nutritional muscular
dystrophy, and ceroid pigment in smooth muscle).  Muscle strength
was measured with a bulb ergograph in 45 patients with cystic
fibrosis attending the clinics at the Babies' Hospital, Columbia
Presbyterian Medical Center, New York.  In a double-blind study, in
which half the cases received tocopherol orally, and the remainder
placebo, no significant increase in muscle strength was found in
those patients receiving tocopherol over a period of 6 months as
compared to the placebo group.  Blood tocopherol levels in the
treated group returned to normal.
