Despite the extraordinary prevalence of upper respiratory allergy and
infection in children nasal polyposis is an extremely rare condition.
Seven cases of cystic fibrosis are presented in order to demonstrate
the nasal aspects of the disease. All but one had nasal polyposis.
The literature has been reviewed with particular reference to
clinical, radiological and histo-pathological features. Conservative
treatment is stressed.
