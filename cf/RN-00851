ALPHA-FETOPROTEINS: me.  CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: bl.

HETEROZYGOTE.  HUMAN.  RADIOIMMUNOASSAY.

Serum alphafetoprotein concentrations were measured by three
different types of radioimmunoassay in 30 patients with cystic
fibrosis of the pancreas and in 55 controls. The highest value
obtained in cystic patient was 10.2 ng/ml and in a control 10.8
ng/ml. These are within published normal limits. Previously reported
large increases in serum AFP in patients with cystic fibrosis and in
heterozygote carriers have not been confirmed.
