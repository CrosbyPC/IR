Treatment of mucus hypersecretion in human disease should first be
directed at prevention.  The hypersecretion of mucus, even in the
absence of pus in the sputum or of other signs of infection, is of
itself associated with significantly poor lung function.  Infection
is probably the important stimulus in cystic fibrosis.  Certain
anti-inflammatory agents are now known to cause retention of mucus
within the secretory cells although the rate of synthesis is not
raised.  It may be that this offers a new way of control.  On the
other hand, the cells become larger and this may be undesirable.  I
would prefer to see a study of the effect of drugs on the cellular
stages of synthesis and discharge rather than concentration on
mucolytic agents.
