An adult male was recently discovered to have cystic fibrosis after a
unique clinical presentation not mentioned in the review article.
This patient with recurrent episodes of heat exhaustion and
hyponatremia had no extraordinary source of Na+ loss other than his
sweat.  This case represents an important new presentation of cystic
fibrosis.  Most internists view this disease as one seen only in
chronically ill children.
