Letter: Defective essential-fatty-acid metabolism in cystic fibrosis.

CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: me.  FATTY-ACIDS-ESSENTIAL: me.

HUMAN.  PHOSPHOLIPIDS: me.

Mr Rivers and Mr Hassam propose that the subnormal levels of
linoleic acid (18:2) found in the plasma-phospholipids of patients
with cystic fibrosis are due to malabsorption.  To substantiate
their hypothesis they deduce that the remarkable remission observed
in a cystic-fibrosis patient given intravenous 'Intralipid' was due
not to the 18:2 content of the 20% triglyceride component of the fat
emulsion but to the 20:4 content of its 1.2% phospholipid component
(not 6% as they state).  This explanation seems unlikely in view of
the relatively small proportion of 20:4 in intralipid phospholipid,
especially since intravenous administration of intralipid
phospholipid to healthy subjects decreases both the 18:2 and 20:4
content of their plasma-phospholipids.  Comparison of the effects of
complete intralipid versus intralipid phospholipid on the level of
20:4 in the plasma-phospholipids of patients with cystic fibrosis
would soon determine whether they lack the ability to desaturate
18:2 to 20:4.
