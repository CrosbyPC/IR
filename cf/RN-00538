The papers by Elliott and by Campbell et al. suggest a new approach
toward etiology, pathophysiology, and therapy in patients with cystic
fibrosis.  As in Elliott's original report of the effects of
intravenous fatty acid therapy for CF, the patients in the present
report fared remarkably well, particularly in regard to weight gain.
The paper of Campbell et al. suggests that oxygen does not simply
diffuse across membranes, but that instead its transport is
influenced by the fatty acid composition of the membrane.  Elliott's
suggestion that the disarranged fatty acid metabolism may be related
to altered prostaglandin production is attractive.  These studies do
not prove whether fatty acid and/or prostaglandin alterations are
secondary to intestinal fat malabsorption or are related to the
primary metabolic defect in CF.
