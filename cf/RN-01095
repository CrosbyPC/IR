Palpable purpura was noted to occur late in the course of some
patients with cystic fibrosis. Skin biopsy specimens showed
necrotizing venulitis characterized by a perivenular infiltrate
composed of neutrophilic leukocytes, fibrin, hypogranulated mast
cells, and endothelial cell necrosis. Circulating immune complexes
were detected. Recurrent pulmonary infections and the chronic
administration of therapeutic agents provide sources of potential
antigens.
