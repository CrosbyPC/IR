Cystic fibrosis has attracted the attention of biomedical
investigators because it is the most prevalent chronic disease
inherited in Caucasian children.  Carriers of the gene leading to
cystic fibrosis occur quite frequently in the Caucasian population.
A major aim in research on cystic fibrosis is the development of a
test that will offer reliable detection of the heterozygote and of
the fetus with cystic fibrosis.  Considerable numbers of patients
with this disease are not diagnosed until after death.  The therapy
of patients with cystic fibrosis is still symptomatic and includes
appropriate diet (or diets), pancreatic enzyme and vitamin
supplementation, treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary
involvement and chronic infections by antibiotics, physical therapy
and inhalation therapy, psychoemotional support, and vocational
rehabilitation.
