The Paediatric Gastroenterology Clinic at this hospital was started
to follow children with gastroenterological problems after discharge
from hospital and in particular to monitor their clinical and dietary
progress.  Other dietitians who see an opening for this work in their
hospitals may find our experiences to be of interest.  Gluten-free
diets, cow's milk free diets, sugar intolerance, cystic fibrosis, and
non-specific cases are discussed.
