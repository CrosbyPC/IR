RESEARCH.

Advances have been made in two areas of cystic fibrosis research at
the University of Missouri School of Medicine.  First, investigations
have improved understanding of the normal mechanisms that underline
the production of exocrine secretions.  The second involves recent
observations relating to important efforts to develop methods for
heterozygote detection.  The author concludes that efforts should be
made to shift emphasis in research from qualitative bioassays to more
reliable detection systems.
