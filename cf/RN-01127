Dr Hosli and Mrs Hosli reported that differential thermolability of
plasma alpha-mannosidase and plasma acid phosphatase allowed
discrimination between normal people, cystic fibrosis carriers, and
patients.  We have repeated these experiments, paying special
attention to the technical details given in the Hoslis's paper.  In a
separate series of experiments we used larger volumes of plasma for
each assay, which was performed either with or without
non-fluorescent paraffin oil.  In both cases the blood samples were
processed exactly as outlined in Hosli and Vogt's paper.  There were
no significant differences in the heat stability of plasma
alpha-mannosidase and acid phosphatase between the three groups.
