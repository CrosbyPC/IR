This paper reviews some of our efforts to compare mucous
glycoproteins from the tracheobronchial tract of cystic fibrosis
patients with those of control subjects.  We have used secretions
from several sources, including sputum, bronchial washings obtained
with the aid of the fiberoptic bronchoscope, tracheobronchial
aspirates through endotracheal or tracheostomy tubes and, finally,
secretions discharged by human tracheobronchial epithelial explants.
Solubilization and fractionation of secretions; properties of the
major mucous glycoprotein components; composition of major components
from non-infected, bronchitic and CF lungs; and organ culture of
human tracheobronchial epithelium are discussed.
