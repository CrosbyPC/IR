Statistical discriminant analysis is applied to 41 concomitant
variables obtained during the first year of study of 226 patients
with cystic fibrosis. A discriminant function based on six variables
is developed which can be used as a predictive index. This index
estimates the probability of 5-year survival for an individual
patient and can also be used to classify patients into one of two
groups: (1) will live for 5 years or (2) will die within 5 years.
Speculation A classification rule for cystic fibrosis is presented
which correctly assigns 90% of the 5-year survivors and 84% of those
who expire. Such a classification scheme is useful for clinical and
research purposes.
