Screening of the newborn for genetically determined diseases is one
thing when sought by parents who know they are likely to pass a
defective gene to their offspring; it is another thing altogether to
apply screening tests to all newborns, irrespective of individual
risks.  In Australia, in the foreseeable future, the best hope for
infants and children born with cystic fibrosis lies in the
application of the proven sweat test technique whenever any of the
numerous presenting features of the disease crops up.
