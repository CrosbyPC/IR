False negative sweat tests with apparently adequate sweat
collections.

Sweat tests collected on two or more occasions from normal children
and children with cystic fibrosis have been analysed according to
the weight of sweat collected.  In five cases collections of 50-99
mg of sweat gave false negative results.  Although 50-100 mg of
sweat is considered adequate by some authorities our results do not
support this.  The study confirms the view that at least 100 mg of
sweat must be collected to give reliable results.
