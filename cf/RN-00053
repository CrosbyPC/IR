The levels and properties of microsomal glycoprotein
galactosyltransferase of cultured skin fibroblasts from control and
cystic fibrosis patients were investigated using bovine submaxillary
gland mucin as the exogenous acceptor.  Although the mean specific
activity of this enzyme was higher tin cystic fibrosis fibroblasts,
the difference was not significant.  The properties of the enzyme as
regards pH optimum, metal ion and Triton X-100 requirement, apparent
Km, heat stability and nucleotide/sugar-nucleotide response were
similar for control and cystic fibrosis fibroblasts.
