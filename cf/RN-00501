Over the past few years, studies from various laboratories have
suggested the presence of a factor(s) in cystic fibrosis serum
causing widespread in vitro abnormalities of components of the lung
defence mechanism particularly with respect to macrophage
dysfunction, quantitative and qualitative alterations in mucus, and
ciliary motility.  The possible in vivo role of ciliary dysfunction
in the pathogenesis of the disease is of particular clinical
interest.  Since an in vitro ciliary dyskinesia factor had been
previously demonstrated and pulmonary complications are the hallmark
of CF, yet clearance in most of our clinically stable CF subjects was
relatively well maintained, this suggested to us that a mucociliary
transport abnormality might be present intermittently.  In order to
explore this further, we designed nasal mucociliary clearance studies
to determine whether CF serum might exhibit MCT inhibition in vivo.
From these studies, we concluded that there was a substance(s) in CF
serum which had the capacity to slow MCT.  Whether this effect is on
the cilia themselves or via overproduction of normal or abnormal
mucus is not known.
