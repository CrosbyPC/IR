The meconium plug syndrome (MPS) is a common cause of low intestinal
obstruction in newborn infants. Usually, it is benign and not
associated with other intestinal dysfunction. We describe the cases
of three infants in whom there was intestinal obstruction consistent
with the MPS and in which cystic fibrosis (CF) was later documented.
We suggest that there is an association between the MPS and CF, and
that the condition of all infants with the MPS be evaluated for the
possibility of both Hirschsprung's disease and CF.
