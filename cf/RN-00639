Using a micro-method for the determination of plasma arginine
esterase activity, we have investigated the values for soybean
trypsin inhibitor (STI)-inhibited arginine esterase activity in
patients with cystic fibrosis, obligate heterozygotes and age matched
control individuals. The mean of STI-inhibited activity is lowest for
cystic fibrosis patients while the mean for normal controls is the
highest. The mean of STI-inhibited activity for the heterozygotes is
midway between the values of the patients and the normal individuals.
The deficiency of arginine esterase activity was statistically
significant for both cystic fibrosis patients and heterozygotes.
