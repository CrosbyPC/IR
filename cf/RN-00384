Well children show a steady increase of staphylococcal precipitins
throughout life.  Lower incidences are found for precipitins against
H. influenzae, Pneumococcus, and haemolytic streptococcus.
Precipitins against Proteus, Pseudomonas, and Klibsiella are rare.
There are marked differences between the normal children and the
cloxacillin-treated children with cystic fibrosis in respect to
Pseudomonas and H. influenzae which rise to over 50% of cystic
fibrosis children in the third quinquennium.  However, the
development of staphylococcal precipitins can be prevented by
continuous antistaphylococcal therapy.
