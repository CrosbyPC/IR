Responses to treadmill exercise of 36 patients with cystic fibrosis
were studied to evaluate their usefulness in identifying those with
atopy. Ten of 36 patients with cystic fibrosis (28%) had an abnormal
response to exercise but had no more frequent atopic characteristics
than those who had normal exercise responses. Response to treadmill
exercise alone cannot identify patients with atopic disease among
those with cystic fibrosis.
