Meconium ileus in the neonate is the presenting symptom in 10 to 20
per cent of instances of cystic fibrosis of the pancreas.  Similar
intestinal obstruction occurring later, in the post-neonatal period,
is a rare occurrence, and was called "Meconium Ileus Equivalent" by
Jensen.  Of 40 cases affected by this syndrome reported in medical
literature, only 13 were infants.  We report a 7-week-old patient
who died 3 days after surgery for small bowel obstruction.  The
clinical suspicion of cystic fibrosis was confirmed at autopsy.
