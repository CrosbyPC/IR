The control of symptoms in dying children is often sadly neglected.
This neglect is reflected in a review of the case notes of two
children who died of cystic fibrosis within three years of each
other.  The girls were under the care of the same consultant, who in
the interval between the two cases was introduced to the concept of
proper terminal care for children.  These two cases show that illness
can cause physical, emotional, and spiritual pain to family and
staff.  In retrospect these areas of distress were not clearly
defined in either case and opportunities to alleviate suffering were
missed.  The principles of controlling symptoms need to be remembered
as much during distressing treatment as during the distress of dying.
