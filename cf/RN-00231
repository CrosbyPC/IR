From 39 normal children and 36 patients, suffering from cystic
fibrosis (C/F), the copper content of finger nail clippings and toe
nail clippings were determined. From this study it can be concluded
that, although the patients with cystic fibrosis (C/F) have a higher
copper content, the determination of copper in nail samples cannot be
used in order to differentiate between normal children and patients.
Also higher mean copper concentrations were found in finger nail
clippings in comparison with toe nails. This difference was
significant for patients with cystic fibrosis.
