Twelve patients with cystic fibrosis were started on an artificial
diet of Albumaid and Caloreen, together with a supplement of medium
chain triglyceride oil, vitamins, and minerals.  Growth velocity and
general health were assessed over a period of a full year for each
child.  Patients who were only mildly affected by the disease showed
improvement in stool frequency and growth rate when the diet
represented the major part of their nutritional intake.  Patients who
were severely affected showed no improvement in growth, general
clinical status, or frequency of respiratory infections.
