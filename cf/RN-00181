Assessment of nutritional status of patients with cystic fibrosis of
the pancreas (CFP) showed that poor growth was associated with low
concentrations of albumin, urea nitrogen, and cholesterol in serum
and with elevated white blood cell (WBC) counts. Patients with CFP
maintained weight approximately 1 standard deviation below the mean
until 8 years, after which there was a progressive decline in growth
rate compared to normal. A complete dietary supplement consisting of
a beef serum hydrolysate, a glucose polymer, and medium-chain
triglycerides was given to 15 patients for a year. Patients who
received the diet showed significant gains in weight, significant
increase in clinical score, significant increase in serum albumin
level, and a significant drop in the WBC count compared to control
patients who did not receive the supplement.
