Finger-clubbing has been measured from the magnified silhouette of
the right index finger (shadowgram) in 125 subjects, comprising
children and young adults. The profile and hyponychial angles were
both found to be good discriminators of clubbing and to be
independent of age and sex. The normal profile angle was 168.3
degrees +/- 3.6 and the mean normal hyponychial angle was 180.1
degrees +/- 4.2. Patients with cystic fibrosis and cyanotic
congenital heart-disease were found to have grossly elevated values
of these angles. Some asthmatics were found to have a moderate degree
of clubbing with significantly elevated values of these angles. The
shadowgram proved a convenient objective method for recording the
degree and progress of fingerclubbing in clinical practice.
