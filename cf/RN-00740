Electrophoretic analysis of serum proteins in cystic fibrosis

BLOOD-PROTEINS: an.  CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: bl.
ELECTROPHORESIS-POLYACRYLAMIDE-GEL.  ISOELECTRIC-FOCUSING.

GAMMA-GLOBULINS: an.  HETEROZYGOTE.  HUMAN.

We have attempted to reproduce the isoelectric focusing in thin layer
polyacrylamide gels (IEFAG) method specified by Wilson et al. in our
laboratory.  Since the resolution obtained with their procedure
appeared to be inadequate for identifying single protein bands in the
relevant region, we have incorporated several methodologic
improvements into the isoelectric focusing technique.  These
improvements have significantly enhanced the resolution and have thus
enabled us to demonstrate a greater degree of heterogeneity of serum
gamma-globulins than is visible in the paper of Wilson et al.
Despite the significant increase in the number of bands resolved by
our method, a difference among CF, heterozygote, and control sera in
the pH 8.4 - 8.5 region could not be detected.  In addition, the
two-step IEFAG/disc electrophoresis technique of Altland et al. has
been tested in our laboratory.  We have also modified this analytic
procedure, enabling the fractionation of several small proteins from
a portion of the IgG fraction.  Again, despite an improvement in
resolution which reveals more heterogeneity, no unique protein has
been observed consistently in the CF and heterozygote area.
