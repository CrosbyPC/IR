Twelve patients with meconium ileus equivalent complicating cystic
fibrosis in the postneonatal period were seen at the Mayo Clinic in
the years 1950 through 1975. In a child or young adult with known or
suspected cystic fibrosis, the triad of recurrent colicky abdominal
pain, a mass in the right lower quadrant, and mechanical intestinal
obstruction provides a clue to diagnosis of meconium ileus
equivalent. The clinical suspicion of meconium ileus equivalent may
be confirmed by meglumine diatrizoate (Gastrografin) enema, which in
most uncomplicated cases also serves as treatment.
