The course of 95 patients with cystic fibrosis is presented.
Survivors have a mean follow-up period of over 14 years (minimum: 13
years). Of 45 patients diagnosed prior to extensive irreversible
pulmonary involvement, only one has died and none is disabled. In
contrast, of the other 50 patients diagnosed after substantial
irreversible pulmonary disease was present, 26 have died. Mortality
and morbidity has been greater in females. Possible factors
contributing to the improving prognosis include early diagnosis,
aggressive management with comprehensive care, easy access to
specialized care, and improved antimicrobial therapy.
