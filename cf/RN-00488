Cystic fibrosis heterozygosity in the pathogenesis of allergy.

CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: fg.  HETEROZYGOTE.  HYPERSENSITIVITY: et.

ALLERGENS: du.  COMPARATIVE-STUDY.  FEMALE.  HOMOZYGOTE.  HUMAN.
HYPERSENSITIVITY: di, fg.  MALE.  SKIN-TESTS.

47% of cystic fibrosis (C.F.) heterozygotes had positive prick skin
tests of 1 or more of 9 antigens and 53% had histories of allergic
disease, both occurring significantly more often than in a control
group. Since 1 in 20 of the population are C.F. carriers, this would
contribute to allergy in the community.
