Using the immunoelectrophoretic method alpha-1-antitrypsin was
detected in all but 6 of 26 samples of duodenal fluid obtained from
16 patients with various gastroenterological problems. The
concentrations (mg/100 ml) of alpha-1-antitrypsin in duodenal
aspirates from children with liver disease (7.32 plus or minus 6.1)
were less than those from children with cystic fibrosis, Shwachman
Diamond syndrome, or Hirschsprung's disease (16.7 plus or minus 11.9;
p smaller than 0.02). Alpha-1-antitrypsin was detected in all but one
of 6 samples of gallbladder bile, the exception being that from a
patient with extrahepatic biliary atresia. No significant correlation
was found between the alpha-1-antitrypsin concentration in the
samples studied and the corresponding total antitrypsin activity.
