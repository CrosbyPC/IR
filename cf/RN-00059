Sera from 31 of 146 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) contained
levels of serum alkaline phosphatase (AP) which were elevated by
age-related criteria.  Prominent liver isoenzyme bands were present
after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of all 31 abnormal sera.
Larger than normal amounts of bone and intestinal AP were not
present in these sera.  These findings indicate that liver
abnormalities consistently are responsible for elevations of total
AP in sera of patients with CF.  Several causes of high liver AP
levels in CF patients were identified: chronic hepatic congestion,
drug hepatotoxicity, overt biliary cirrhosis, and most commonly
subclinical focal biliary cirrhosis.
