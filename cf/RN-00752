The initial roentgenograms of 178 consecutive newly diagnosed
patients with cystic fibrosis seen during the past five years were
reviewed to determine the presence of fatty liver.  Seven cases of
visibly fatty liver were identified.  The incidence of visibly fatty
liver on the initial roentgenograms in newly diagnosed cases of
cystic fibrosis was 4%.  The cause of fatty infiltration of the
liver in cystic fibrosis is not clear; however, the basis is most
likely a nutritional deficiency in protein.
