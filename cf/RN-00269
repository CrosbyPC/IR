Plasma membranes have been isolated without proteolytic modification
from fibroblast lines derived from patients with CF, from
heterozygous parents, and from normal children. The cells had been
grown in the presence of 3H- OR 14C- labeled L-leucine, D-
glucosamine, and L-fucose. Membranes were mixed in suitable
combinations to allow comparisons to be made between the different
cell types. No differences in the plasma membrane composition, as
revealed by divergence in 3H- or 14C-profiles, could be detected
after gel electrophoresis. Identical protein and glycoprotein
components were present in approximately similar amounts in all
groups of cells;
