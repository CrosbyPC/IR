It has been suggested that patients with cystic fibrosis may have an
intrinsic abnormality of thyroid function that may be enhanced by
the administration of iodides.  We wish to report an infant with CF
in whom hyperthyroidism developed, in the absence of a goiter,
following short-term iodide therapy.
