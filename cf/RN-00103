Letter: Skin wrinkling in cystic fibrosis.

CYSTIC-FIBROSIS.  SKIN-MANIFESTATIONS.

HUMAN.  IMMERSION.  WATER.  HEAT.

The letter from Professor Elliott appears to be the first record of
skin wrinkling in cystic fibrosis and may be an observation as
important as that of di Sant' Agnese when he noted the high salt
concentration of the sweat.  It seems that parents are well aware
of this response, and repeating Professor Elliott's observation by
soaking the hands of six infants with cystic fibrosis in hot water
showed that very marked wrinkling was present by five minutes and
often by two minutes.  This did not occur in control children of
similar nutritional state except in a case of twins - one with
cystic fibrosis, one without - where the unaffected child's fingers
began to wrinkle slightly by five minutes.  The wrinkling does not
appear to be associated with wasting due to malnutrition since it
occurs equally in plump and in thin infants with cystic fibrosis,
nor is it present in children with severe wasting and respiratory
disease not due to cystic fibrosis.
