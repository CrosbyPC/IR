A positive approach to cystic fibrosis [editorial].

CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: nu.

CHILD.  FAMILY.  HOME-NURSING.  HUMAN.

The child with cystic fibrosis presents a heart-breaking problem to
parents, since the disease is inherited equally from both mother and
father, and there is the possibility that other children will be
similarly afflicted.  Perhaps the most valuable advice the nurse can
give to parents is to adopt at all times a positive approach to their
problem.
