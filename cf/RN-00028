The present study points out the simplicity and ease of using
fingernails and toenails to measure electrolyte levels as a test
for cystic fibrosis.  Procedures and various effects on the ranges
of values for different categories of healthy and diseased subjects
are discussed and the limitations of the method are indicated.
