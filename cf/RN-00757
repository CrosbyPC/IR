A study of 35 patients with cystic fibrosis demonstrated that
increasing severity of pulmonary involvement was associated with a
mild but definite increase in erythrocyte 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-
DPG) and a decrease in hemoglobin affinity for oxygen. The
predominant regulators of 2,3-DPG were blood pH, cardiac output, and
systemic oxygen transport. No significant relationship was observed
between erythrocyte 2,3-DPG content and arterial oxygen tension.
Hypophosphatemia may have prevented a greater increase in erythrocyte
2,3-DPG content. The inadequate increase in 2,3-DPG and consequent
insufficient change in hemoglobin-oxygen affinity, coupled with an
insufficient compensatory erythrocytic response, may adversely affect
tissue oxygenation in patients with severe cystic fibrosis.
