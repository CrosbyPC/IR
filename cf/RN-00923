We confirm that thymidine-requiring (thy-) Staphylococcus aureus
strains are common in patients with cystic fibrosis.  In 7 months, we
isolated Staph. aureus from 11 of 14 patients with C.F.  Despite
long-term co-trimoxazole Staph. aureus tends to persist in the sputum
even though isolates do not require thymidine at first and are
trimethoprim-sensitive in vitro.  Staph. aureus is less commonly
isolated, and of less significance, in most other chest conditions
for which co-trimoxazole is given.  These factors may explain why
thy- staphylococci are recognised more frequently in C.F. than in
other diseases.
