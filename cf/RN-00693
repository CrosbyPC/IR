The University of Kansas group have established that pancreatic
extracts, in the doses currently used in the management of patients
with cystic fibrosis, cause hyperuricosuria which may occasionally be
symptomatic.  They correctly worry about long-term ill effects of
such therapy.  In treated CF patients the uricosuria results
primarily from the increased dietary purine load, though the abnormal
transport physiology in CF may contribute.  Even though final
evidence on risk is not at hand, prudence would suggest holding the
purine load in CF patients to the minimum needed to ensure digestion
of sufficient foodstuffs without necessarily permitting a "normal"
diet sans steatorrhea.  Alternatively, purified enzyme preparations
free of the remaining sweetbread could eliminate the excess nucleic
acid intake and be administered in a dosage permitting the luxury of
redundant safety.
