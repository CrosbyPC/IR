Patients with cystic fibrosis are likely to develop nasal polyps and
pansinusitis.  This presentation concerns the results of various
surgical procedures used to treat nasal polyposis in cystic
fibrosis.  At present recurrent nasal polyposis is still the major
problem following surgery.  The literature does not deal
specifically with comparisons of different surgical procedures aimed
at controlling nasal obstruction or with the surgical management of
sinus disease in cystic fibrosis patients.  Perhaps this lack
reflects the unsatisfactory results that would have to be reported,
since a high recurrence rate is expected.  Also the prolonged
survival in these children means that more of them are reaching
adolescence and adulthood with an increasing risk for nasal
obstruction and nasal polyposis.
