Sixty-one patients with cystic fibrosis were studied to determine the
relationship between degree of compliance with taking antibiotics and
severity of the disease. The compliance rate was high in these
patients, suggesting that perception of the severity of the disease
and the potential consequences of discontinuing medication is a
principal factor.
