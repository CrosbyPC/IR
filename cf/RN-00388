Disease in the small airways leads to alteration in the slope of
phase III of the single breath nitrogen washout following a breath
of 100% oxygen.  Normal children and those with asthma and cystic
fibrosis were studied by this technique.  Measurement of the slope
of phase III of the single breath washout appeared to be a sensitive
indicator of abnormal pulmonary function in children with these
diseases.  Results obtained in many children with cystic fibrosis
suggested that the upper lung regions were predominantly affected.
