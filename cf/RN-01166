Factors influencing the frequency of cystic fibrosis in South West
Africa.

CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: oc.

CHILD.  CONSANGUINITY.  CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: fg.  FEMALE.
GENE-FREQUENCY.  HUMAN.  MALE.  NAMIBIA.  PEDIGREE.

Drift, chance effect in a small community and consanguinity have
resulted in South West Africa's high cystic fibrosis incidence.
Isolated communities generations ago in Europe, e.g. Bad Gastein,
where this congress was held, surrounded by its Alpine peaks, could
have resulted in gene enrichment, which together with the increased
fertility of the heterozygote could still be responsible for most of
the CF seen wherever Europeans live today.
