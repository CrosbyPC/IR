The effectiveness of ticarcillin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in
acute exacerbations of pulmonary infection in patients with cystic
fibrosis was evaluated. Seventy-one percent of patients treated with
ticarcillin alone responded favorably. The response rate was similar
in patients treated with a combination of ticarcillin plus gentamicin
or with gentamicin alone. Severity of the underlying disease was the
most important determinant of response to treatment. Ticarcillin-
resistant organisms were recovered during treatment in 50% of
patients who received this drug; recovery of them was not prevented
by the inclusion of gentamicin in the therapeutic regimen nor did
they interfere with clinical improvement. The ticarcillin-resistant
strains persisted at follow-up, two to six months after completion of
therapy, in only one of ten patients. No serious toxicity to
ticarcillin was noted during the study period.
