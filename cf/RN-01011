In the province of Limburg, all newborn babies are screened for
metabolic anomalies: for amino acidopathies since 1968, for
galactosemia since 1974 and for mucoviscidosis since 1978.  On
127,676 newborns, there were 12 cases of phenylketonuria and 3 other
inherited anomalies.  A meaningful policy of the government on
neonatal screening necessarily requires a good organization, to put
together the screening data, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up.
