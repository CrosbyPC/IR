Detection of cystic fibrosis protein (CFP) using out method involves
rather exacting requirements for the collection of serum samples and
their subsequent analysis by electrofocusing.  Minor variations in
the methods described for sample collection and storage may cause
degradation and loss of CFP and this by itself could lead to
erroneous results since many CF samples would appear to be CFP
negative, making it impossible to observe a consistent difference
between a group of CF samples and normal control samples by
electrofocusing.  From the results presented by Thomas et al. and
Figure 1 of the letter by Smith et al., it is obvious that neither
group has reproduced the protein handling patterns presented in
either of our previous reports.  The pH gradients are not the same,
the location of the sample pads relative to the anode are not the
same, and the protein banding patterns are totally different.  We
question the validity of the techniques used, claims of having
reproduced our method for detecting CFP, or supposed improvements
designed to enhance the detection of CFP.
