Cystic Fibrosis is a generalized hereditary disorder of children,
adolescents, and young adults in which there is widespread
dysfunction of mucus-secreting glands.  The patient's condition may
be characterized by one or all of the following: chronic pulmonary
disease, pancreatic enzyme deficiency and abnormally high sweat
electrolytes.  Hence, each patient is treated on an individual basis.
Parents tied to a rigid regime imposed by the disease must have help;
volunteers are needed to support and assist them at home and at
school.  Cystic Fibrosis still needs a lot of help, and knowledge
and understanding on the part of the nursing profession helps a great
deal.
