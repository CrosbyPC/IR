Prostaglandins and cystic fibrosis.

We have investigated two aspects of prostaglandin function in cystic
fibrosis: the response of platelets to PGE1, and the concentrations
of PGE2 and PGE-alpha in the sweat.  Low concentrations of PGE1 have
less effect on platelet agglutination in CF patients and
heterozygotes than in normals, but no difference is observed when
high PG concentrations are used.  Sweat PGE2 and PGE-alpha
concentrations are similar in normals, CF patients and heterozygotes,
but sweat PGE2 concentrations are proportional to Na/Cl levels in CF,
but not in control children or heterozygotes.
