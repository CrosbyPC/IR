CASE-REPORT.  CHILD.  FEMALE.  HUMAN.  SYNDROME.

Taussig et al reported a case of a 6-year-old boy with the Russell
variant of the Silver-Russell syndrome concomitant with cystic
fibrosis.  We would like to describe another patient who had the
same combination of diseases.  The pattern of clinical findings in
this patient are in accordance with that of the Silver-Russell
syndrome.  It is, of course, possible that the development of
cystic fibrosis in this patient is entirely accidental, although
such a coincidence would be a statistically rare event.  The
establishment of a possible relationship between these two
conditions would depend on reports of other similar cases.
