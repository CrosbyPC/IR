Cystic fibrosis--1.  Clinical aspects.

CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: di.

CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: th.  HUMAN.  INFANT.  PROGNOSIS.

Cystic fibrosis is a fatal inherited disease involving many different
organs.  At one time most affected children died within a few years
of birth but modern management has led to a marked improvement in
prognosis and, of course, to an increase in the number of affected
older children and young adults.  Cystic fibrosis is, therefore, no
longer a disease encountered only in paediatric units, but with
increasing survival into teens and twenties affected patients are now
appearing in adult units.  The aetiology and pathology, the clinical
picture, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis are discussed.
