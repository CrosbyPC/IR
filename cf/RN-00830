Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease, usually fatal
before the third decade, characterized by chronic obstructive lung
disease, elevated sweat electrolyte concentrations, and pancreatic
insufficiency.  The present investigation was carried out to
determine if P-type serum RNase activity was reduced in CF patients 3
to 24 years of age.  No difference in serum RNase activity was found
among the groups of 17 normals, 21 CF patients, and 5 CF
heterozygotes.  It appears that observations of decreased RNase
activity in the serum of young children with pancreatic insufficiency
cannot be extended to older children, at least without withholding
pancreatic supplements.
