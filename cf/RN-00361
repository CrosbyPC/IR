The morphologies of the adrenal cortical zones of 25 children with
cystic fibrosis and 24 control patients are presented. A technic for
objective measurement of these zones is described. Hyperplasia of the
zona glomerulosa in the children with cystic fibrosis is significant
and may be related to chronic loss of salt in the sweat or demands
placed on renal salt-conserving mechanisms.
