Sweat tests in cystic fibrosis [letter].

CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: di.  SWEAT: an.

CHILD.  CHLORIDES: an.  ECZEMA: di.  FALSE-POSITIVE-REACTIONS.
HUMAN.  SODIUM: an.

Dr Smalley and her colleagues rightly stress that the commonest
reason for abnormally high sweat-electrolyte levels, apart from
cystic fibrosis, is faulty technique.  A further cause of
false-positive results, and potentially more important than the list
of rare disorders usually cited, is atopic dermatitis.  Dr M. Ampola
and I investigated ten children with eczema at the Tufts New England
Medical Center, Boston, and found higher sodium and/or chloride
levels in sweat obtained from affected skin than in sweat from normal
skin in the same individuals.  In four of these atopic children,
levels within the diagnostic range for cystic fibrosis were obtained
(above 60 mmol/l).
