Fatty infiltration of the liver has been identified
roentgenographically in several young children. Awareness of this
possibility will sometimes allow a radiologist to contribute to the
understanding of the patient's metabolic and nutritional state. If a
child's liver is shown to be abnormally radiolucent, cystic fibrosis
should be considered.
