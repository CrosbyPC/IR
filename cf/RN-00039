For Caucasians of European origin, cystic fibrosis (CF) remains the
commonest recognized autosomal recessive disorder, but it appears to
be a rarity among the coloured races.  For a time, records may have
suggested an association between CF and whiteness; in recent years,
however, instance of CF children have been described whose racial
origins are Negroid, Mongoloid, and non-European Caucasoid.  The
present case reports concern 3 Pakistani children born in Birmingham,
in whom Cf has been confirmed.  2 of the 3 (Cases 1 and 2) were
brother and sister.  The present incidence of this disease among
Asian immigrants in the West Midlands is approximately 1:10,000.
