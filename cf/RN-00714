High breast-milk sodium in cystic fibrosis [letter].

CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: me.  MILK-HUMAN: an.  SODIUM: an.

FEMALE.  HUMAN.  PREGNANCY.

Increased sodium concentration in sweat is a characteristic of cystic
fibrosis.  However, we have read nothing on the sodium content of
breast milk in this condition.  A patient with sweat-test-proved
cystic fibrosis with mild pulmonary disease had her first baby by
normal delivery at term.  Samples of breast milk were obtained on the
sixth and seventh days post partum when the mother was not breast
feeding.  The two sodium concentrations were 132 and 280 mmol/l,
concentrations much higher than in any other milk sample tested at
this hospital in a large survey and higher than any we have seen in
the literature.  Milk of such high sodium content would be unsafe for
a baby, and we suggest that, if mothers with cystic fibrosis were to
breast feed, the sodium of the mild should be measured first.  The
breast, like so many other exocrine glands, seems to be affected by
the secretory abnormalities of cystic fibrosis.
