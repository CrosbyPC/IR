Ca2+-ATPase activity, high affinity Ca2+ binding in the presence and
absence of ATP and low affinity Ca2+ binding at added CaCl2
concentrations of 1 microM, 100 microM and 10 mM were measured in
isolated erythrocyte membranes from cystic fibrosis and control
subjects.  No significant difference was detected between the two
groups for any of these measurements.
