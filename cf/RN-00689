The possibility has been raised that complement plays a role in the
pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis (CF).  This impairment would be
consistent with the thesis that the alternative pathway had been
activated in vivo and, therefore, depleted.  The purpose of this work
is to explore further the function of the alternative pathway in
cystic fibrosis.  Examination of the data using Student's t test and
analysis of variance showed no significant difference in the mean
hemolytic activity of sera of CF patients as compared to the control
group.  The data presented do not support the work of Polley and
Bearn who demonstrated an abnormality in CF patients using conversion
of C3 by inulin as assay.  The reason for this discrepancy is not
clear.  Our results do not preclude in vivo activation of the
alternative pathway, since a compensatory increase in synthesis of
components could offset component consumption.  Since the net result
is a completely normal level of activity, however, it does not seem
likely that significant consumption has occurred.
