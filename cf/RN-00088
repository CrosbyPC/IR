Staphylococcal empyema is not a rare occurrence in patients with
cystic fibrosis, occurring in as many as 4.5 per cent of such
patients in our recent experience.  In some patients, it may be the
presenting illness in infancy.  Cystic fibrosis patients with empyema
now constitute a significant percentage (approximately 3 to 7 per
cent) of the total number of patients hospitalized with empyema.
Since most of these empyemas occur in infancy and most are of
staphylococcal origin, sweat tests should be done on all infants
admitted with staphylococcal pneumonia with or without empyema,
particularly when recovery with adequate treatment is unduly
prolonged.
