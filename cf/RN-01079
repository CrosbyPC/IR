It is the purpose of this review to present evidence for a disorder
which is believed to be caused by defective cilia and to review some
data on the occurrence of abnormal cilia, evidently formed in
response to environmental insults.  The cilium, human ciliated
structures, the immotile-cilia syndrome and other inborn ciliary
diseases, cystic fibrosis, and acquired disorders of ciliated
structures are discussed.  Ciliary activity is not vital, but its
loss will cause a great deal of discomfort.  The greatest problems
relate to the lower respiratory tract, which is also a site of most
of the cilia in the body.  It is striking that a certain degree of
clearance can be maintained in the lungs in the absence of motile
cilia by coughing, hawking, and other mechanisms.
