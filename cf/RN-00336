Proliferation rates and cellular protein content have been measured
in cultured fibroblasts derived from the skin of normal volunteers
and cystic fibrosis patients. Three methods of measuring growth
indicated that under our conditions, CF fibroblasts divide normally
with a  mean doubling time of 29 hr. During the logarithmic growth
phase, however, lower cell protein/DNA ratios were observed
consistently in CF cultures. This difference was not present in
contact-inhibited, confluent fibroblasts. The finding of an apparent
reduction in protein synthesis during rapid division, coupled with an
observation by others that CF fibroblasts fail to normally induce
collagen formation, suggests the possibility of a disturbance in the
biochemical regulation of protein synthesis.
