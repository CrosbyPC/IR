In a previous communication, written in response to a letter by
Smith et al., we suggested several possible reasons for the
inability of Thomas et al. and other investigators to detect cystic
fibrosis protein (CFP) using electrofocusing techniques.  Thomas and
coworkers communicated with us for the purpose of determining
possible reasons for their inability to detect CFP by
electrofocusing.  Key points made during these conversations are
reiterated below in a firm attempt to alleviate future problems by
inexperienced investigators in their attempts to use analytic
electrofocusing to detect CFP.  In our communications with Thomas
and coworkers we learned that, despite our suggestions, they had not
analyzed the samples they screened by either using the equipment of
Awdeh et al. or employing our standardized procedure.  It is unknown
whether or not they exercised the requirements for serum sample
collection, processing, and storage.  We feel the above reasons are
sufficient to explain the reported failure of Thomas et al. to
reproduce our results and to detect consistently a CFP in sera from
individuals with the CF gene.
