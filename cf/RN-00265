Mucoid strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from the
respiratory tract of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), those
obtained from non-CF patients, and those obtained in vitro by the
action of phage, were found to be stable in their mucoid colonial
form when serially subcultured on deoxycholate-citrate agar. The
ability of anionic, cationic and neutral surfactants to stabilise
mucus production is described. The possible importance of dipalmitoyl
lecithin as a stabilising agent for mucus production in vivo is
considered, with particular reference to the role of mucoid P.
aeruginosa in CF disease.
