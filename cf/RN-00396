Eleven episodes of "meconium ileus equivalent" have been seen in six
adults with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas. Three patients were
initially treated surgically; one died and the other two developed
serious postoperative chest infections. Six episodes were
successfully treated medically with acetylcysteine orally and by
enema, nasogastric suction, and intravenous fluids. Operation should
be avoided if possible, and maintenance treatment with acetylcysteine
may be necessary to prevent relapse.
