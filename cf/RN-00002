Salivary amylase levels were determined in normal subjects from
birth until adult life and in children with conditions sometimes
associated with low pancreatic amylase such as malnutrition, coeliac
disease and cystic fibrosis.  Mixed saliva was collected under
carefully standardised conditions and amylase was measured by the
method of Dahlqvist.  There was a wide scatter of values in the 84
normal subjects, but concentrations rose from very low levels at
birth to reach adult levels by the age of 6 months to 1 year.
Salivary amylase activity rose normally over ten weeks in one
premature infant fed milk by gastrostomy.  Thirteen children with
coeliac disease and 9 children with cystic fibrosis mostly had
normal salivary amylase concentrations.  Six out of 12 malnourished
children with jejunal villous atrophy of uncertain aetiology had low
levels which rose to normal as recovery began.
