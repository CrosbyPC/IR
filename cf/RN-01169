SKIN-TESTS.

Patients with cystic fibrosis have a higher incidence of positive
skin prick tests than normal; this may be the result of defective
antigen handling at mucosal surfaces.  Our aim was to investigate
bronchial allergy in a group of children with CF and positive skin
tests.  We studied 15 children aged 7 to 16 years with mild to
moderate respiratory disease.  Only 1 child gave a history of
wheezing not associated with chest infections and this study supports
the hypothesis that clinical asthma is a product of bronchial allergy
and broncholability.  The responses to bronchial provocation with
Aspergillus suggest that allergy to this antigen may play a part in
the pathogenesis of lung disease in some patients with CF.
