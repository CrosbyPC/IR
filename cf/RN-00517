This article provides evidence that opportunistic infection can be
expected in chronically debilitated, immunosuppressed persons.  The
onset of an infectious disease in these patients can be sudden or
insidious with few prodromal signs.  Anorexia, malaise, fever, and
vomiting are nonspecific symptoms that these children may manifest
because of their primary illness or its treatment.  Any insult to
natural defense barriers may cause serious infections in the
compromised host.  An infected wound from an insect bite, easily
controlled by local measures in a healthy person, may become a focus
for septicemia in a child with leukemia.  Despite the diagnosis and
appropriate treatment of the specific infection, the
immunosuppressed person is still subject to overwhelming infection by
resistant opportunistic organisms until the natural defense
mechanisms are restored.  An awareness of the vulnerability of the
compromised host is the key to effective diagnosis and management of
the various complications of infectious disease.
