Sera from 40 well-confirmed cystic fibrosis patients and 60 of their
parents were obtained through two Canadian (Chicoutimi and Quebec)
and one United States (San Diego) cystic fibrosis clinics.  AFP was
measured by two methods: a double antibody enzyme immunoassay and a
sodium sulphate precipitation radioimmunoassay.  Our results thus
confirm that serum AFP levels are normal in cystic fibrosis.
