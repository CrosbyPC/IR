Pulmonary function and cardiopulmonary complications were studied in
a group of 40 patients with cystic fibrosis who reached the age of 25
years. Mean values for vital capacity (VC), functional residual
capacity, residual volume (RV), the ratio of RV over total lung
capacity (RV/TLC), conductance, and the ratio of the forced
expiratory volume in one second over VC were abnormal. There was a
variable pattern of progression from patient to patient. The men
differed from the women only in that they had a significantly larger
TLC and inspiratory capacity than the women. The resultant
preservation of VC may have an advantage for survival in those
patients in whom it is observed. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was
encountered with increasing frequency with age. Massive hemoptysis
did not result in early death. The occurrence of rightsided heart
failure secondary to cor pulmonale, with or without respiratory
failure, was a poor prognostic sign.
