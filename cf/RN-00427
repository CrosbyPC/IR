Although the incidence of pseudomonas infection is low in the total
hospital population, certain conditions predispose to such
infection, which can be life-threatening.  Patients with cystic
fibrosis are a special group, since a majority have chronic
pulmonary infections with pseudomonas, often of a mucoid variant
rarely found in other patients.  Several approaches are being tried
in CF patients, but none shows much promise thus far.
