The syndrome of ataxia-telangiectasia is characterized by ataxia,
progressive neurologic degeneration, cutaneous and conjunctival
telangiectasis, and immunologic deficiency.  Roentgenologic evidence
of chronic pulmonary and sinus infections and decreased lymphoid
tissue will usually be present.  As the sinopulmonary abnormalities
resemble those of cystic fibrosis, a small adenoidal mass may be of
differential aid.
