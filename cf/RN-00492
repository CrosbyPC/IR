The Boehringer Mannheim test meconium strip advertised for detection
of cystic fibrosis was, like many other diagnostic aids, marketed
before its reliability was proven.  The test is positive in many
infants who do not have cystic fibrosis, and may be negative in those
who have the disease.  It is therefore unacceptable for routine
screening of newborn infants for cystic fibrosis.
