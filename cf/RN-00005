The capacity of duodenal juice to hydrolyse casein to
trichloroacetic acid-soluble peptides was investigated: in a control
group (11 infants and children and 7 adults); in 5 children with
pancreatic disease; in 10 children with enterogenic malabsorption
(coeliac disease and cow's milk protein intolerance).  The
proteolytic activity per ml duodenal juice in fasting condition was
as great in healthy infants and children as healthy adults (500-600
mg casein/ml/hour).  There was a good correlation between trypsin
content and proteolytic activity of duodenal juice.  In pancreatic
insufficiency, the proteolytic activity was extremely low (not
measurable in 3 patients) as was the trypsin activity whereas in
enterogenic malabsorption, it was within the ranges of the controls.
