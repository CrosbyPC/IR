PALPATION.

A case of cystic fibrosis presenting as a right lower quadrant mass
in a five-year-old white female is presented. At laparotomy, a
mucoid, impacted appendix was found which microscopically suggested
the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis must be added to
conditions presenting with abdominal masses.
