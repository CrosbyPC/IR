Letter: Skin wrinkling in cystic fibrosis.

CYSTIC-FIBROSIS.  SKIN.

HUMAN.  IMMERSION.  TIME-FACTORS.

Dr. Economou-Mavrou and his colleagues appear to have misunderstood
my previous note concerning skin wrinkling in cystic fibrosis.  The
range of normality varies in different climatic conditions, and in
Aukland wrinkling does not appear in cool tap-water (18-22 C) under
3 minutes in normals.  Skin wrinkling on immersion appears to be
age-related, but is difficult to detect reliably in the newborn.
Prior washing of the hands, or immersion in sea-water (even the day
before), accelerates skin wrinkling, as does warm weather.  I would
suggest that "normality" needs redefining in Athens if 6 of 17
"normals" were "abnormal".
