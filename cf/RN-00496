A biochemical study of bronchial mucins in sputum from patients with
cystic fibrosis was undertaken in order to determine their chemical
features and to compare them with bronchial mucins secreted in other
physiological or pathological conditions.  The mucins studied in the
present work were obtained from the insoluble and fibrillar part of
sputum.  If bronchial mucins are the main glycoproteins in the
fibrillar mucus, these data suggest that there is a high proportion
of acidic mucins within the bronchial secretions from CF patients.
The predominance of acidic mucins may not be a specific feature of CF
since the sputum from the 2 patients with other diseases had a
similar mucin distribution.  As far as CF is concerned, it is
presently impossible to state whether the bronchial mucins represent
normal mucins of the child or structurally abnormal molecules.
