Immediate hypersensitivity in patients with cystic fibrosis.

CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: im.  HYPERSENSITIVITY-IMMEDIATE: im.

ALLERGENS: ad.  CHILD.  CHILD-PRESCHOOL.  GEL-DIFFUSION-TESTS.
HUMAN.  IGE: an.  INFANT.  PRECIPITIN-TESTS.  SKIN-TESTS.

Twenty-three out of thirty patients with cystic fibrosis gave strong
immediate skin hypersensitivity reaction to a wide variety of
allergens. Seventy-five per cent of these had a markedly elevated
serum IgE concentration whereas those patients who had negative Type
1 immediate skin reactions also had normal levels of serum IgE. The
sputum of those patients with immediate skin reactivity also had
positive precipitins to a variety of antigens.
