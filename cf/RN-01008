This review describes the development and application of a novel test
to determine levels of human immunoreactive trypsin, an enzyme
produced solely by the pancreas, in biological fluids. Being organ-
specific, the assay of immunoreactive trypsin should be an ideal
marker of pancreatic function, and this is supported by the results
of a number of clinical and research investigations. Use of this
assay in studies of chronic pancreatitis, juvenile-onset diabetes,
and cystic fibrosis has yielded much valuable data, and it is
expected that further research will lead to an improved understanding
of these and other conditions associated with the pancreas in health
and disease.
