A voluminous literature has dealt with the variety of pathologic
entities that may effect the liver and the pancreas.  Much of it
includes poorly or vaguely documented observations.  Only a few
facets have been subjected to experimental study.  Despite the
resultant difficulty in unraveling reported and inferred
relationships between the two organs, the available information has
been analyzed according to the following arbitrary categorization:
(1) involvement of the liver in pancreatic disease, (2) involvement
of the pancreas in hepatic disease, (3) involvement of both organs
in systemic disease.
