Using pH-microelectrodes the excretion of hydrogen-ions and
bicarbonate in relation to flow rate was investigated in a single
sweat gland of cystic fibrosis children.  The results show decreased
excretion of hydrogen-ions and an increased excretion of
bicarbonate.  Evidence is presented that due to reduced secretion of
hydrogen-ions in the duct both the reabsorption of sodium and the
secretion of potassium may be impaired.  Reduced flux of protons
across the luminal membrane of epithelial cells is proposed as a
general feature of exocrine gland defects.  It is then possible to
describe both the cationic transport defect of the sweat gland duct
and the anionic bicarbonate-secretory defect in one term.
