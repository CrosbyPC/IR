Six tests recommended for use in the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis
(CF) have been compared in the same subjects. The tests were carried
out on 165 normal persons, 64 known cases of CF, their 67 parents and
18 sibs. The tests measured sodium in fingernails by activation,
sodium in saliva and chloride in saliva and in thermal and
pilocarpine-induced sweat by means of ion-specific electrodes, and
chloride in pilocarpine-sweat by the standard titrimetric method. The
tests ranged in complexity from simple screening methods to
individual clinical procedures. None of the simpler tests matched the
standard pilocarpine method in diagnostic efficiency, whether they
were used singly or in combination.
