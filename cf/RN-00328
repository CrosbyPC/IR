Cystic fibrosis is a genetically determined disorder.  The evidence
that cystic fibrosis is inherited in this way comes from several
sources.  The birth frequency of cystic fibrosis is unexpectedly high
in Britain for such a serious illness.  It is easy to calculate the
proportion of the population who are carriers from the birth
frequency of the disease.  The explanation of the unlikely high birth
frequency of cystic fibrosis in Europe is not known.  An attempt to
reduce substantially the birth frequency of cystic fibrosis will
become possible once it is practicable to detect reliably the carrier
of the gene.
