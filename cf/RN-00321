Clinical, bronchoscopic, spirographic, scintigraphic, and chemical
analyses were done in 24 children with cystic fibrosis to assess the
mucolytic effects of acetylcysteine inhalations versus L-arginine
hydrochloride aerosols. The latter drug is less active than
acetylcysteine and should not be used to treat children with cystic
fibrosis.
