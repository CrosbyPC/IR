Prenatal diagnosis of cystic fibrosis [letter].

CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: di.

FEMALE.  HUMAN.  PREGNANCY.  PRENATAL-DIAGNOSIS: mt.

As far as I know, no test for the prenatal diagnosis of cystic
fibrosis has yet been shown to be reliable, but several experimental
studies on prenatal diagnosis of cystic fibrosis are being carried
out.  Deficient protease activity, assayed by 4-methylumbelliferyl
guanidinobenzoate, an active site titrant of serine proteases, has
been reported in plasma and cultivated skin fibroblasts from patients
with cystic fibrosis.  Another prenatal diagnostic test for cystic
fibrosis involves the observed resistance of patients' skin
fibroblasts to dexamethasone (a synthetic glucocorticoid) toxicity,
in comparison to normal fibroblasts.  Specific induction of alkaline
phosphatase with Tamm Horsfall glycoprotein, isoproterenol and
theophylline has been recorded in skin-derived fibroblasts from
affected patients.
