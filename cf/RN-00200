Despite the availability of specific antibiotics, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa bacteria still cause troublesome infections in patients
with a variety of illnesses: extensive thermal injury, leukopenia
from antineoplastic chemotherapy and other forms of immunosuppressive
treatment, chronic pulmonary disease such as cystic fibrosis, or
intravenous narcotic use. The use of antibiotics has improved the
prognosis of pseudomonas infections considerably. However, patients
with marginal or defective host immunity may need more extensive
therapy to master the infection. By evaluating additional modalities
of treatment such as granulocyte replacement, improved usage of
antibiotics, and active (prophylaxis) or passive antibody
administration, the optimal combination may be found.
