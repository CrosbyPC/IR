Effects of sputum from patients with cystic fibrosis on the activity
in vitro of 5 antimicrobial drugs on Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

ANTIBIOTICS: pd.  CYSTIC-FIBROSIS.  PSEUDOMONAS-AERUGINOSA: de.
SPUTUM.

CARBENICILLIN: pd.  GENTAMICINS: pd.  HUMAN.
MICROBIAL-SENSITIVITY-TESTS.  NEOMYCIN: pd.  POLYMYXIN-B: pd.
TOBRAMYCIN: pd.  SUPPORT-U-S-GOVT-P-H-S.

By in vitro tests on 12 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, sputum
from patients with cystic fibrosis sharply increased the minimal
bactericidal concentrations of polymyxin B and neomycin. Sputum had a
lesser effect on tests with gentamicin and tobramycin and essentially
none on tests with carbenicillin.
