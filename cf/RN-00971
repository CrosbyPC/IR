Cultured skin fibroblasts from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are
more resistant to dexamethasone toxicity than are normal cells. We
now report that, when fibroblasts cultured from obligate CF
heterozygotes are exposed to dexamethasone, they have an intermediate
survival compared to normal and homozygous CF cells. When
dexamethasone survival was tested on cells from four patients
undergoing amniocentesis, cells from a woman at risk of producing a
child with CF showed significant dexamethasone resistance, similar to
that of fibroblasts derived from lnown CF homozygotes; the other
amniotic cell specimens showed dexamethasone sensitivity similar to
that of normal skin fibroblasts. These data suggest that the
dexamethasone resistance previously observed in skin fibroblasts may
also be useful in the prenatal diagnosis of CF.
