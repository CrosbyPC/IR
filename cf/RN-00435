The general area of research at the biochemical and molecular levels
related to cystic fibrosis has suffered from the lack of a suitable
animal model.  Although some animal models have been proposed, these
have not yet been tested.  In attempts to circumvent this problem
several investigators have turned to cell culture techniques to study
various aspects of cystic fibrosis.  These studies have included the
use of red blood cells, lymphocytes, skin fibroblasts and cultured
nasal polyps.  There are enough positive indications from this
approach to indicate that it might be fruitful.  Consequently, a
final aspect of this article will be a consideration of the use of
cell cultures for future investigations into the possible metabolic
lesions in cystic fibrosis.  Control of cyclic nucleotide levels in
parotid, the role of calcium, microfilaments and microtubules in
secretion, and the use of cell cultures as an approach to the study
of biochemical defects in cystic fibrosis are discussed.
