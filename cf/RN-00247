The past 50 years in developed countries have seen a steady decline
in infant mortality from diseases associated with infections and
malnutrition.  During the period the contribution from genetic
diseases and congenital malformations has risen significantly.
Genetically oriented screening programs have a high potential to
contribute to the overall improvement of health in both developed
and underdeveloped countries.  In this review only procedures for
screening for hereditary biochemical disorders will be considered.
Criteria for selection of genetic traits to be screened, the schedule
for screening, specimens for screening, the screening of newborn
infants, the testing of older infants, the testing of high-risk
infants and children, the screening of families with genetic
diseases, and screening for carriers in selected populations are
discussed.
