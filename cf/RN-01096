HLA determinants in families with more than one member with cystic
fibrosis [letter].

CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: im.  HUMAN.

Attempts to identify the carrier state for cystic fibrosis (CF) or to
make a prenatal diagnosis of CF have been unsuccessful.  One approach
to this problem is to look for associations between known genetic
markers and the locus for CF.  In general these studies have looked
at the frequency of HLA types in patients with CF and have failed to
demonstrate a strong association.  We attempted to look for linkage
between HLA haplotypes and CF in families with more than one affected
member.  The segregation of HLA in these affected sibpairs vary
little from the expected.  Although the sample size is small, it is
unlikely that a close linkage exists between the HLA loci and the CF
locus.
