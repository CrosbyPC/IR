Population screening is the carrying out of some test or procedure on
every individual within a population defined by such limits as
geography, administration, race, sex or age.  At risk screening is
the carrying out of such a test or procedure on a person or persons
for whom there already exists some medical reason to suppose that the
findings may be positive.  This review of conditions for which
population screening may be considered is not exhaustive, but it
serves to show the central dilemma in this field, which is that,
apart from congenital dislocation of the hip, phenylketonuria and
possibly homocystinuria, none seems to show quite strong enough a
case to be considered worthwhile screening for on its own.
