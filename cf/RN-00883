Children with cystic fibrosis have skeletal maturation and epiphyseal
anomalies similar to those in children with nutritional problems.
However, these patients have been found to have normal somatic
development if treatment is begun early. In a group of children with
cystic fibrosis undergoing medical treatment, cephalometric
measurements compared favorably with those established by normal
standards.
