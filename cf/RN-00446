Cor pulmonale was defined by a committee of the World Health
Organization as "right ventricular hypertrophy, secondary to disease
of the lung parenchyma or pulmonary vasculature, or due to
abnormalities of pulmonary function."  It has been estimated that 70%
of children dying with cystic fibrosis have cor pulmonale, though as
children live longer, the number may be higher.  Clinical diagnosis,
management, prognosis, echocardiography, echocardiography as a
measure of left ventricular dysfunction, and a study of 94 ambulatory
and hospitalized cystic fibrosis patients are discussed.  The study
establishes that in patients with cystic fibrosis, left ventricular
dysfunction and hypertrophy occur and are related to increasing
severity of pulmonary involvement.
