Prolactin is credited to have a role in the maintenance of
electrolytic and water balance by the kidneys although its effect on
the composition of sweat is unknown.  We assayed prolactin, growth
hormone and alpha-fetoprotein in the sera of 69 children with cystic
fibrosis attending the Hospital for Sick Children.  Sera from 12
children without cystic fibrosis were used as control.  It appears
that children with cystic fibrosis have serum levels of prolactin, GH
and alpha-FP similar to those without this disease and that children
have significantly higher levels of alpha-FP than women of
reproductive age.
