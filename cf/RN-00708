The absorption of biosynthetically 59Fe-labeled hemiglobin, pork and
hog liver, 60 Co-vitamin B12 and 75Se-selenomethionin labeled pork
was measured in children with cystic fibrosis by whole body counting
of the absorbed radionuclides within the 4-pi geometry of a large
volume radioactivity detector with liquid organic scintillator.
