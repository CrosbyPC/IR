Meconium can be defined as the first stools passed by a newborn
infant, the first stool being passed within 24 hours of birth by more
than 90% of newborns.  This paper will review current knowledge on
the sources of meconium, and its composition in health and disease
states.  The precise origin of the components of meconium has not
been defined.  The qualitative and quantitative patterns of the
individual constituents of meconium in health are considered: water
and inorganic elements, enzymes, plasma proteins, glycoproteins,
lipids, haemoglobin metabolites, steroids and bile acids, and
sterols.  Meconium from infants with cystic fibrosis has been more
extensively studied than in any other disease and the paper
concentrates on this entity.  The composition of meconium in cystic
fibrosis, screening tests for cystic fibrosis, the diagnosis of
cystic fibrosis, and meconium ileus are discussed.
