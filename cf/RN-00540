Seven children with cystic fibrosis (CF) have been treated for at
least one year with intravenously administered soya oil emulsion. In
all, an improvement of at least one biochemical abnormality in
character with the disease appeared. The children's clinical course
remains benign. This course is remarkably better than that of other
children with CF treated without Intralipid in Auckland in the same
period, though a placebo effect cannot be discounted. It is
postulated that intravenous supplementation with essential fatty acid
in CF may in turn partially correct an error of metabolism of
prostaglandins present in the disease.
