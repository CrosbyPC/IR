It has long been believed that the mucociliary apparatus of the
airways serves to remove inhaled particulate matter from the
tracheobronchial mucosa, thereby contributing to pulmonary host
defense.  This review deals mainly with factors affecting
mucociliary transport that may be of clinical importance.  The
information available at present strongly suggests that mucociliary
transport, at least in central airways, is impaired in most patients
with cystic fibrosis; however, it is still unclear whether this
disorder is a nonspecific feature of the chronic inflammatory airway
disease or represents an essential factor in the pathogenesis of the
pulmonary abnormalities.
