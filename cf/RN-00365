The gene frequency for slow and fast electrophoretic variants of
complement C3 in Caucasian individuals with cystic fibrosis was
similar to the values expected for unaffected controls, thereby
ruling out a suspected differential involvement of these phenotypes
with the disease. In one family, cystic fibrosis and complement C3
phenotypes segregated independently.
