A syndrome of dwarfism and retarded sexual development among Iranian
and Egyptian teenage boys has been shown to be due to zinc
deficiency.  A British patient with cystic fibrosis and nephrotic
syndrome showed growth retardation and hypogonadism, associated with
low plasma zinc concentrations.  The combination of cystic fibrosis
and nephrotic syndrome appears to be fortuitous, and undoubtedly
adverse effects on zinc homoeostasis were cumulative.  Nevertheless,
zinc deficiency should be considered when somatic and sexual growth
failure occur in patients with cystic fibrosis.
