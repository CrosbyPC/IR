Diarrhoea can be defined as the passage of loose stools and increased
bowel frequency above the accepted norm for the individual and
resulting in excess loss of water and electrolytes in the faeces.  It
may or may not be associated with steatorrhea (fatty stools).
History plays a vital part in the diagnosis of gastro-intestinal
disease in children.  Time spent here is often more rewarding than a
battery of specialised investigations.  One must be clear what the
parent means by diarrhoea, as terminology among doctors, nurses, and
parents is often confusing.  When dealing with children one must
always adopt a comprehensive approach and consider the whole child
and his family.  Common causes, mechanisms, and consequences are
discussed.  Some of the common causes of diarrhoea are cystic
fibrosis, gluten-induced enteropathy (coeliac disease), Giardia
lamblia, sugar intolerance, gastro-intestinal allergy, and irritable
bowel syndrome.
