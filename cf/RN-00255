Absorption of two antibacterial drugs, cephalexin and
co-trimoxazole, in malabsorption syndromes.

CEPHALEXIN: me.  MALABSORPTION-SYNDROMES: me.  SULFAMETHOXAZOLE: me.
TRIMETHOPRIM: me.

CELIAC-DISEASE: me.  CHOLESTYRAMINE: ae.  CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: me.

Plasma concentrations and urinary excretion of cephalexin,
trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole) were measured in
normal subjects and in patients with coeliac disease, small bowel
diverticulosis, Crohn's disease, cystic fibrosis (cephalexin only)
and after administration of cholestyramine.  The absorption of
cephalexin was improved in coeliac disease diverticulosis and cystic
fibrosis.  In Crohn's disease the peak plasma level was reduced and
delayed.  The absorption of both trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole
was increased in all three conditions.  However there was a
disproportionate increase in the plasma level of trimethoprim in
coeliac disease and diverticulosis when compared with that of
sulphamethoxazole.  In Crohn's disease there was a threefold
increase in the peak plasma level of sulphamethoxazole.  After
cholestyramine administration there was malabsorption of all three
drugs.
