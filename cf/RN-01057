The activity of alpha-L-fucosidase is decreased in the serum of
cystic fibrosis patients when compared to age-matched controls. This
result, combined with the elevated activity in skin fibroblasts,
supports the concept of an abnormal intracellular and extracellular
distribution of alpha-L-fucosidase in cystic fibrosis.
