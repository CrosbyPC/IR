We were interested in Professor Elliott's description of early skin
wrinkling in children with cystic fibrosis.  Although this
phenomenon may well be related to osmotic differences between skin
and water, it has been observed that skin wrinkling (as seen on the
finger pulp) is fully dependent on an intact peripheral
nerve-supply.  This is a useful sign in peripheral nerve lesions
and helpful in following recovery when the wrinkling returns.
Furthermore, it was our impression that in normal individuals
wrinkling was more apparent on the left hand than on the
right-handed individuals.  However, in a preliminary study using
fingerprint densities measured by photometry, no significant
differences were found between the sides.
