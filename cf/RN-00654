On electrophoresis, parotid saliva always exhibits a basic pattern of
6 isoamylases. Additional faster migrating isoamylases occur in
varying numbers. These "fast isoamylases" are generated, at least in
part, by deamidation. Compared with juvenile and adult controls, a
significantly greater number of "fast isoamylases" was found in the
parotid saliva of children with cystic fibrosis and their healthy
heterozygous parents. A shift in the equilibrium between amidation
and deamidation is discussed in terms of its possible connection with
the metabolic defect responsible for cystic fibrosis.
