The relationship between the dosage of pancreatic extract and the
excretion of uric acid was investigated in 29 patients with cystic
fibrosis and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Urinary excretion of
uric acid was normal in patients receiving small doses of pancreatic
extracts and abnormally high in those receiving large amounts. In the
latter group, normouricosuria was achieved by reducing the dose of
pancreatic extract. Normal stool patterns and adequate weight gains
were preserved by a diet modification that was well accepted by the
patients. To eliminate the potential renal consequences of
hyperuricosuria, it seems appropriate to control the need for
increasing amounts of pancreatic enzymes by limiting the dietary
intake of fat and maintaining a positive caloric and nitrogen balance
with high intake of protein and carbohydrates and supplementation
with medium-chain triglycerides.
