We believe that serum-levels of individual complement components in
children cannot be meaningfully interpreted unless they are compared
with normal values obtained from age-matched controls.  In a study
of 163 healthy infants and children we found a statistically
significant correlation of C3 levels with age, but not with sex or
race, and we also found a wide range of values within any given
age-group.  In contrast to previous reports, we did not find raised
C3 levels in the majority of our C.F. patients when the values were
compared with projected group mean values for the appropriate age,
and we did not find a significant elevation of the mean C3 level for
the C.F. patients in any of the age-groups tested.
