9 out of 204 unselected cystic fibrosis (CF) patients seen at the
Department of Pediatrics, University of Berne, Switzerland, over the
last 20 years had clinically overt liver disease. In 7 patients liver
cirrhosis was demonstrated (3.4%). Focal biliary cirrhosis was the
pertinent finding in 3 cases, whereas another 3 showed unspecific
nodular cirrhosis. One infant presented with prolonged obstructive
jaundice due to partial extrahepatic atresia and delayed passing of
meconium. Two other patients had steatosis. A review of the
literature dealing with clinical and laboratory findings in CF
patients with liver disease is given.
