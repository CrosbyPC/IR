Do brine shrimp diagnose cystic fibrosis?.

CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: di.  SHRIMP.

ANIMAL.  BIOLOGICAL-ASSAY: mt.  CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: fg, bl.  GENOTYPE.
HUMAN.  OXYGEN-CONSUMPTION.  SALIVA.  SHRIMP: me.
SODIUM-CHLORIDE:  pd.

The nauplii of the brine shrimp Artemia salina are dependent upon the
function of their salt gland to maintain osmotic pressure within
narrow limits. A number of drugs interfere with this function and are
lethal to the nauplii. Saliva and serum from normal persons, patients
with cystic fibrosis, and obligate heterozygotes were tested for
lethal effect against brine shrimp nauplii. At salt concentrations
between 100 mM and 2.5 no difference was found among the phenotypes.
At lower concentrations a difference was noted occasionally between
some normal subjects and some individuals carrying one or two genes
for cystic fibrosis. Data from an independent series of experiments
indicate that the naupliar deaths result from distorted ratios of
Na+/K+ and not from a specific gene product. No difference was noted
in the O2 uptake of nauplii treated with saliva or serum obtained
from normal subjects, patients with cystic fibrosis, or obligate
heterozygotes.
