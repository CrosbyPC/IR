The main characteristic of patients with cystic fibrosis is lung
involvement; the fatal outcome of the disease is most often due to
pulmonary complications.  Since the paper by West et al. (1954) on
pulmonary function in cystic fibrosis, the importance of lung
function studies in this disorder has been stressed in several
publications.  We have studied lung function in a number of children
and young adults with cystic fibrosis.  The results have been
correlated with clinical, radiological, and bacteriological
findings.
