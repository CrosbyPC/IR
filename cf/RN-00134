Diarrhea can be defined as excess loss of water and electrolytes in
feces, but what is an excess?  To the physician, fecal losses may be
excessive when they cause the patient to be ill; to a parent a stool
pattern that differs from that of a neighbor's infant or even a
single watery stool may be too much.  New knowledge of normal gut
function and the pathologic processes that may afflict the child's
alimentary tract has improved one capability to diagnose and manage
certain specific diseases that cause diarrhea.  Although of great
interest to academicians, many of these diseases are extraordinarily
rare and in most practices there is a substantial and perplexing
pool of poopers in whom no specific disease can be found.
Fortunately, patients in this latter group are rarely seriously ill.
This article attempts to help the practitioner understand, diagnose
and treat children with specific diseases known to cause chronic
diarrhea.  We will speculate also on the mechanisms and management
of idiopathic chronic diarrhea.
