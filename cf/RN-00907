RETROSPECTIVE-STUDIES.

The various treatments of spontaneous pneumothorax in cystic fibrosis
are examined over a 15-yr period. Open thoracotomy with pleural
abrasion is compared to observation, tube thoracostomy, and tube
thoracostomy with instillation of quinacrine. Open thoracotomy with
pleural abrasion has been performed 31 times in 20 patients.
Discussion centers around selection of patients, preoperative
preparation, operative technique, and postoperative care and follow-
up, including analysis of pulmonary function studies. In our
experience, open thoracotomy with pleural abrasion is a safe and
effective method that should be utilized in the management of
pneumothorax in patients with cystic fibrosis.
