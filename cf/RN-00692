Cystic fibrosis in black children.

We feel that cystic fibrosis in the black population occurs more
frequently than 1/17,000 as reported by Kulcycki and Schauf.  Our
experience with black patients does not indicate that their course
and prognosis is different from that in the white population with
cystic fibrosis.
