Patients with cystic fibrosis have a higher concentration of sodium
and chloride in their sweat than normals.  This observation led to
the introduction of an iontophoresis technique for stimulating the
sweat glands with pilocarpine.  Occasionally, electrical burns result
from defective equipment or from an incorrect or badly applied test
procedure.  A new design of equipment is presented which eliminates
the possibility of a burn during the test.
