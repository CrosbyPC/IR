pH of the sweat from patients with cystic fibrosis and in controls
was measured as a function of the sweat-rate using a fluorescence-pH-
indicator (umbelliferone). In both populations sweat is acid at low
sweat-rates and alkaline at high ones. The results do not favour an
abnormality of the ductal H+-secretion as the pathomechanism of
cystic fibrosis.
