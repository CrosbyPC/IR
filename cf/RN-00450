A key to any successful preventive nutritional program is long-term
follow up, reinforcement, and early intervention when necessary.  The
dietitian must evaluate the effectiveness of her approach through
careful monitoring of various parameters of growth, such as length,
weight, head circumference, and skinfold measurements.  It is
essential that she be aware of the advantages, limitations, and
complications of any dietary program.  We have described only three
examples of complex nutritional problems encountered in the intensive
care nursery.  There are many more equally challenging and
frustrating medical and surgical disorders which demand the expertise
of the dietitian for successful management.  The dietitian of the
future cannot rely on knowledge alone, but must utilize considerable
ingenuity and creativity in managing these complicated nutritional
enigmas if acceptance and effectiveness are to be maintained.
