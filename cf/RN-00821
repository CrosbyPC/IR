During the last two decades, great strides have been made in our
understanding of the functional aspects of airflow in the periphery
of the lung. It seems that the small airways are the important site
of obstruction in a variety of chronic respiratory disorders
associated with airflow obstruction. This review deals with the
anatomic and functional aspects of small airways in normal and
diseased lungs. In particular, the basis of obstruction or narrowing
that is not dependent on intrinsic airway lesion is reviewed. The
variety of pathologic changes in small airways observed in these
diseases are outlined along with physiologic tests that are currently
used to detect dysfunction at a stage long before they produce
symptoms or alter standard tests of lung function.
