We wish to respond to the letter of Dr. Woods and Dr. di
Sant'Agnese regarding their study on the reliability of the ciliary
assays in cystic-fibrosis screening.  These investigators concluded
that results from their study ruled out the possibility that
reliable conclusions could be obtained from ciliary assays.  We
feel that this conclusion is far from accurate, although it has
never been the intention of any of our research groups to utilise
ciliary preparations for massive heterozygote screening or prenatal
diagnosis.  Ciliary assays have provided valuable scientific
progress in cystic fibrosis research.  The existing assays are not
suitable for massive screening for cystic fibrosis or for the
clinical detection of cystic-fibrosis carriers; nevertheless, these
techniques offer the most promising method to study, purify, and
characterise a molecule or molecules directly or indirectly related
to the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis.
