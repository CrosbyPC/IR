The nurse is an indispensable member of the team of health
professionals who provide the comprehensive treatment needed by
patients with the complex, emotionally, and physically demanding
disease, cystic fibrosis.  Comprehensive medical management by a
health care team composed of the physician, nurse, social worker,
physical therapist, nutritionist, and psychologist is essential for
patients with CF and other forms of obstructive pulmonary disease.
