The article by Townes et al. provides confirmation of our initial
studies with reference to the isoamylase patterns of serum, duodenal
fluid, and urine in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).  However, the
impression given by Townes et al. in their article is that their data
are the first demonstration of isoamylase abnormalities in cystic
fibrosis.  I wish to point out that out previous work published 2
years earlier and not referenced by Townes et al. demonstrated that
CF patients had decreased amounts of pancreatic isoamylase in their
serum and urine and that the duodenal aspirates in CF patients
contained both salivary and pancreatic amylase.  We concluded, as
eluded to by Townes et al., that salivary amylase in the duodenal
fluid was probably secondary to the intubation procedure.
