This is an X-ray diffraction study of the mineral phases in saliva
and early dental plaque. The salivas studied came from patients with
cystic fibrosis (CF), those with asthma, and heavy and light calculus
formers. One-week old plaque was studied from individuals who are
heavy, moderate, and light calculus formers.
