Some of the serum proteins which bind to heparin and contribute to
the pH 5.57 "heparin binding capacity" of human serum are
glycoproteins; those from cystic fibrosis serum were found to be 27%
higher in fucose (methylpentose) content, 27% lower in sialic acid
content, and 31% lower in hexose content when compared to heparin-
precipitated serum glycoproteins from normal control subjects.
Hexosamine content of the heparin-precipitated serum glycoproteins
was the same. Results of this preliminary investigation indicate that
altered carbohydrate composition in serum glycoproteins may affect
significantly their heparin binding capacity.
