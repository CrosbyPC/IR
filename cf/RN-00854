The activity of sialytransferase with regard to the glycoprotein
substrates asialofetuin and asialo-ovine submaxillary mucin was
determined in normal, pathological control, and cystic fibrosis liver
homogenates. Cystic fibrosis and pathological livers have about 40%
of the average normal specific activity for sialytransferase. Several
properties of cystic fibrosis sialytransferase were investigated and
compared to those of the normal liver enzyme (Alhadeff et al. 1977).
The pH optima curves were similar, but cystic fibrosis
sialyltransferase appears to be more thermolabile than the normal
liver enzyme. Isoelectric focusing studies revealed that the three
most basic forms of sialyltransferase which are found in normal
livers are deficient or absent in most cystic fibrosis liver. The
data suggest that altered glycoprotein-sialyltransferases may be
present in cystic fibrosis livers, probably a secondary effect due to
general liver pathology.
