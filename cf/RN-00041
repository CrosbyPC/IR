Paneth cell metaplasia is a variable feature of diverse diseases of
the colon and rectum.  Paneth cells are numerous in the atrophic
mucosa of chronic ulcerative colitis, in some juvenile polyps, and
around colloid (mucinous) carcinomas.  Moderate numbers of Paneth
cells are found in cystic fibrosis of the pancreas, ambeic colitis,
and in villous adenomas.  Paneth cells are sparse in diverticulitis,
in adenomatous polyps, and around nonmucinous carcinomas.  In this
study, Paneth cell metaplasia is associated with mucus
hypersecretion and mucin deposits.  It is suggested that one
function of the Paneth cell is to control gastrointestinal mucin
viscosity.
