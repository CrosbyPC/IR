The fact that a serum factor in cystic fibrosis patients inhibits
ciliary movement of cells of isolated tracheae, and the observation
that ciliary movement is associated with pinocytotic activity led
Ohno et al. to suggest that this defect is responsible for aplasia or
hypoplasia of the wolffian duct structures in males with cystic
fibrosis.  While Ohno's hypothesis lacks definitive proof, the
hypoplasia or aplasia of the vas in males with cystic fibrosis is
extremely common, producing sterility in affected males.
