Professor R. K. Chandra and others suggest that estimation of serum
alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) might help in detecting carriers in families
at risk for cystic fibrosis.  Observers in the U.K. have been unable
to confirm these findings, whereas Dr. J. A. Smith of New York
supports them.  Perhaps the crux of the matter lies in the technique
of estimating serum AFP.  if a small number of families is analysed
the proportion of affected individuals may differ from the expected.
By chance some families may have all normal children whereas some
may have all affected children.  For example, nowadays, since
families tend to be small, the appearance of an autosomal recessive
condition is often sporadic with only one affected person in the
family.  This could well apply to cystic fibrosis.
