The prevention of fetal malformations and abnormalities has long
been the hope of obstetricians, paediatricians, and geneticists, but
since the cause of most human malformations and of spontaneous gene
and chromosome mutations is unknown, this must remain a dream for
the present.  However, with the introduction of mid-trimester
amniocentesis it is now possible to detect some abnormalities early
enough for selective abortion of abnormal fetuses, though this
should be considered a temporary expedient only.  The abnormalities
which are amenable to this approach are the chromosome aberrations
such as Down's syndrome, the neural-tube malformations including
spina bifida cystica, and some recessively inherited and X-linked
metabolic disorders.
