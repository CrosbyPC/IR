Cystic fibrosis, an autosomal recessive disorder, remains the most
common lethal genetic disease of Caucasian people.  The diagnosis of
CF is usually made based upon the clinical presentation of chronic
respiratory and/or gastrointestinal symptoms, a positive sweat
electrolyte test and, often, a family history of the disorder.  The
manifestations of chronic cough, recurrent pneumonias, bronchiectasis
with clubbing, pneumothorax, hemoptysis, and malabsorption secondary
to pancreatic insufficiency are so well associated with cystic
fibrosis that the diagnosis is usually not delayed.  However, it is
often not appreciated by physicians that CF may be associated with a
broad spectrum of less common manifestations as well as extreme
variability in severity of illness.  Lack of familiarity with these
manifestations may delay diagnosis until adolescence or adulthood.
First, there seems to be mild clinical expression of the disorder in
some patients (genetic variability).  Second, the subtle
manifestations of CF are not widely appreciated by physicians in
practice.
