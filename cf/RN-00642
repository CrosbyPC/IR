It is apparent that bile acid metabolism in the young child must be
evaluated within the context of a maturing organism. Accordingly
information has been presented so that the physician and the
investigator will be able to integrate new data concerning mechanisms
of bile salt action or pose new questions concerning previously
existing hypotheses of hepatic and intestinal function in children.
