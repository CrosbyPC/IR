Intellectual performance, sensory motor abilities and social
adaptation were studied in 41 subjects (2 to 21 years of age) who
had severe malnutrition in infancy.  A control group consisted of
41 siblings.  The mean IQ of 31 parents ws 108 (S.D. plus or minus
11.3).  Socioeconomic deprivation was not present.  The results of
the Merrill-Palmer test for the malnourished group and the controls
revealed significant differences in favor of the controls.  No
differences were found in the older population for whom the WISC and
WAIS were used.  The Lincoln-Oseretsky test of motor development and
the Vineland scale of social maturity showed no significant
differences.  These results are consistent with the hypothesis that
malnutrition in infancy can affect intellectual development in the
first five years of life.  Beyond this age, given adequate
socioeconomic support, no significant differences were observed.
