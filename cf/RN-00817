METHODS.

Screening of sweat chloride in newborn infants with the Orion Skin
Chloride Measuring System and incorporating some procedural
innovations is described. The results indicate that while diagnostic
screening for cystic fibrosis can be readily undertaken, the test
with the chloride ion-selective electrode is best left at least to
the second day of life or later because of insufficient sweating in
very young babies. Measurements on 2 babies with cystic fibrosis are
also discussed.
