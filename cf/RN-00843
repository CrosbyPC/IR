This study compared the use of the fiberoptic bronchoscope with
other lavage techniques under general anesthesia, and of techniques
using the rigid bronchoscope.  Seventy-seven procedures were
performed on 39 patients with cystic fibrosis.  Their vital
capacities were improved in 46 of the 75 valid measurements.
Arterial blood gas levels showed improvements in 14 of the 33 values
obtained.  A prospective study is needed which incorporates the
values of pre- and postoperative MMEV, RV/TLC, flow volume curves
and arterial blood gas values.  An evaluation of the complications
and ease of operation may be of greater value.
