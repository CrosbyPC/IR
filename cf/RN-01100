We report on the examination of stimulated pancreatic secretion using
4-(N-acetyl-L-tyrosyl)aminobenzoic acid in children with cystic
fibrosis.  In controls the urinary excretion of 4-aminobenzoic acid
amounted to 54.8 +/- 11.7% with 19.6% as the lower limit of normal
during six hours, and 74.7 +/- 10.8% and 40.5% during eight hours.
In children with cystic fibrosis the mean values were 5.6% in the
six-hour test and 13.7% in the eight-hour test.  Both values are
significantly different in comparison with controls.  It may be
assumed that both 4-(N-acetyl-L-tyrosyl)aminobenzoic acid and
4-(N-benzoyl-L-tyrosyl)aminobenzoic acid are suitable for indirect
determination of exocrine pancreatic secretion in children.
