In 38 children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis, in 19 normal
children and 62 healthy adults the serum alpha1-fetoprotein
concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay. In cystic fibrosis
patients 97.5% and in normal children 95% of the alpha1-fetoprotein
values were within the normal range for healthy adults (1--9 ng/ml).
Critical judgement of the reported findings in literature and our own
results demonstrate that the investigation of alpha1-fetoprotein in
the serum cannot serve for detecting homozygotes of cystic fibrosis
genes or heterozygote carriers.
