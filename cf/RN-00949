It has been almost 5 years since the publication of our original
report describing a "cystic fibrosis factor" (now designated "cystic
fibrosis protein" or CFP) detected in the serum of most homozygotes
and heterozygotes for cystic fibrosis when analyzed using isoelectric
focusing in thin layer polyacrylamide gels.  The recent report by
Scholey et al. confirms that CFP is present in the majority of CF
sera and that it can be detected by our methods.  Before discussing
whether the CFP can be used as a diagnostic marker for cystic
fibrosis, we would like to examine more closely some of the
requirements of the method which seemed to have been critical for the
detection of CFP by Scholey et al.  We would like to point out that
Scholey and his coworkers adhered closely to most of our guidelines
during their attempts to detect CFP.  The exact nature of CFP and the
other ciliary dyskinesia factors is only partially known, and all
aspects of their metabolism are not yet understood.  Therefore, it
may be some time before we comprehend the incomplete concordance
found between CFP and the pathogenesis of CF.
