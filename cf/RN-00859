Patients with cystic fibrosis have an increased risk for developing
kyphosis and scoliosis. The risk for both kyphosis and scoliosis
increases with age. The severity of kyphosis did not appear greater
in the older age groups. Patients with retarded bone age may be more
likely to have a significant spinal deformity. The presence of spine
deformity does not correlate with the severity of pulmonary
involvement, height, weight, serum protein and albumin in patients
with cystic fibrosis.
