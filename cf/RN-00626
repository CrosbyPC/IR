The mother of two children suffering from cystic fibrosis developed
marked allergic symptoms affecting the eyes, nose and bronchi and
severe bronchial asthma ensued. The cause of this allergy proved to
be the powder released on opening the capsules of pancreatic extract
which she provided for her children at each mealtime. The risk of
pancreatic extract to those handling it, and possibly also to
patients suffering from cystic fibrosis, is emphasized.
