Five glycosidases, alpha-fucosidase, alpha-galactosidase, alpha-
glucosidase, beta-mannosidase and N-acetyl-alpha-glucosaminidase were
studied in human skin fibroblast cultures. The pH-dependency, kinetic
properties of the enzymes and results of isoelectric focusing and ion
exchange chromatography are presented. Techniques suitable for
diagnosing inborn lysosomal diseases in skin fibroblast cultures are
defined.
