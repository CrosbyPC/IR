Cystic fibrosis: a family challenge.

CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: px.  FAMILY.

CHILD.  CHILD-PRESCHOOL.  FEMALE.  HUMAN.  MALE.

To learn how families cope with cystic fibrosis, we interviewed 18
families who gave us vivid descriptions of the day-to-day process of
living with this devastating disease.  The families and the disease
are described.  Pre-diagnosis and diagnosis, home management and
treatment, family communication about CF, the reactions of siblings,
relationships with peers, hospitalization, and sources of support are
discussed.
