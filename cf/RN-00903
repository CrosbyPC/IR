The terminal complement components, C3 to C9, contribute to the
host's defense against infection.  This study was performed to
determine if defective activation of C3 to C9 by bacteria contributes
to the pathogenesis of the recurrent pulmonary infections in cystic
fibrosis.  When each of the bacteria was incubated in the serum of
patients with cystic fibrosis for 30 minutes, the consumption of
available C3 was the same as in the sera of the control patients and
of the two patients with chronic, severe bronchiectasis.  Based on
the results of the present study, it is unlikely that defective
activation of C3 to C9 contributes to the pathogenesis of the
increased susceptibility to pulmonary infections of these patients.
