We studied 113 patients with CF and compared their responsiveness to
inhaled methacholine to that of 50 asthmatic children and 26 normal
children. Positive responses to MCh occurred in 51% of the patients
with CF and 98% of those with asthma. There was a significant
correlation between a positive response to MCh in CF and poor
pulmonary function. There was no relationship between allergic
rhinitis or positive allergen skin tests and a positive MCh response.
Dose-response curves and time course to MCh challenge differed in CF
and asthma. Bronchial hyperreactivity is thus common in CF but is
different from that in asthma.
