The authors of the recent article which failed to show a
significant difference between sweat calcium concentrations of CF
patients and control subjects, suggest that the findings refute our
hyperpermeability hypothesis.  They found sweat Ca of 0.32 to 1.67
mEq/liter in 26 control subjects and 0.42 to 2.03 mEq/liter in 16
CF patients.  With these tremendous ranges many more subjects would
be required to prove or disprove a difference.  A difference
undetectable in a moderate number of subjects is probably not of
pathophysiologic significance if the Ca really varies
unpredictably.  Sweat Ca, however, is generally believed to vary
with the rate of sweating, being much higher at lower rates, and
measurements made at comparable rates might well show significant
differences.  The authors did attempt to control rate, but in a
very inappropriate manner.  They measured no constant rate, but
took the average rate during the 30 minutes immediately after
iontophoresis.  This gives little information concerning the rate
at which the sweat was actually produced.
