Observations on the characteristics of the cell with the cystic
fibrosis (CF) genotype in culture are reviewed. Although numerous and
diverse abnormalities have been described, none were specific for the
CF gene. The relevance of each of these abnormalities to the clinical
syndrome known as CF is discussed, emphasizing that the value thus
far of such cell culture research has been to learn how the CF gene
influences cellular function.
