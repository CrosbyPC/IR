Cystic fibrosis is an inborn disease which affects chiefly the lungs
and the digestive system.  Today cystic fibrosis is known to be one
of the commonest genetic disorders affecting children in Britain.
The children who actually develop cystic fibrosis have inherited the
disease from both parents, who are carriers but are unaffected by the
disease themselves.  Being thick and sticky, instead of thin and
slimy as it normally is, the mucus of the cystic fibrosis case tends
to block the passages instead of clearing them.  The main problem is
in the lungs.  Symptoms, diagnosis, care of nutrition, prevention of
infection, respiratory education, and future research are discussed.
