Increased blood levels of spermidine and an increased
spermidine/spermine ratio is documented in 31 patients with cystic
fibrosis (CF). Some 29 percent of CF patients overlap with the
control group. An abnormality of urinary free polyamines or their
metabolic derivatives related to electrolyte transport, serum
ciliostatic factors, and the autonomic nervous system are elaborated
upon.
