VENOUS-PRESSURE.

Three cystic fibrosis infants with severe respiratory distress had
increased intracranial pressure (with bulging fontanels) which
cleared parri passu with improvement in the chest condition. It is
proposed that the intracranial hypertension is a result of raised
venous pressure, itself secondary to the intrathoracic obstruction to
venous return, consequent on the bronchial obstructive disease.
