Young adults with cystic fibrosis have lower blood pressures than
control subjects of similar age and sex. The low blood pressure may
be related to the excessive loss of salt in the sweat of these
patients. A beneficial effect of the cystic fibrosis gene may be
protection against developing hypertension in both the homozygous and
heterozygous states, especially if the heterozygote has borderline
elevation of sweat electrolytes.
