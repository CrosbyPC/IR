Lung function tests were conducted in 35 patients with cystic
fibrosis and correlated to class of skin fibroblast metachromasia.
Seven patients belonged to class I (vesticular metachromasia), 16 to
class II (generalized metachromasia), and 12 to class III (no
metachromasia).  Class I patients had significantly lower vital
capacity (VC) than class II patients.  As regards the other lung
function tests, no general trends were found in class I patients
compared with the other two classes.  For class III patients the lung
function tests reflected more serious lung changes than those of
class II patients; statistically significant differences were found
as regards residual volume/total lung capacity, one-second forced
expiratory volume (FEV1), and FEV1/VC.  The differences were not due
to varying intensity of treatment.  The results are in accordance
with the findings in a previous study of the clinical and
radiological lung symptoms and serum protein values in CF when
correlated to metachromatic classes.
