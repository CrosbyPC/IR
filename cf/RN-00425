The DNA and dry mass content of lymphocytes of normal controls,
heterozygotic and cystic fibrosis patients have been studied
utilizing biophysical instrumentation.  The lymphocytes from CF had
Feulgen-DNA mean values significantly lower than the normal
controls.  DNA values for CF lymphocytes exhibited two
sub-population values.  The mean dry mass (total protein) values
exhibited greater intercellular variability among CF cells.  The dry
mass:DNA ratio was higher in CF than in normal controls, and this
ratio appeared to increase concomitantly with advance of disease.
