Submaxillary saliva from reserpine-treated rats was found to have
alterations in composition similar to those reported in the same
secretion from patients with cystic fibrosis. Changes included
elevated concentrations of Na+, Ca++, protein, and carbohydrate. In
addition, this saliva was found to have ciliotoxic properties similar
to those of CF serum. The similarities in cilioinhibitory effects
salivary composition, and histologic appearance justify the use of
the chronically reserpinized rat as a model for cystic fibrosis.
