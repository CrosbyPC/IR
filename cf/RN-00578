Anatomical dead space was measured in 72 normal children aged from 5
to 16 years, using the single breath method. There was a linear
increase in this measurement with height, weight, and end-inspiratory
lung volume. Physiological dead space was measured in 52 normal
children using the Bohr equation and substituting a rebreathing PCO2
for alveolar PCO2. There was a parallel increase in this measurement
with height, weight, and end-inspiratory lung volume. The difference
between the two dead space measurements constitutes the alveolar dead
space and was constant over the whole age range at 45 +/- 22 ml. The
ratio of physiological dead space to tidal volume was 33-6 +/-4-6%
and was unaltered by age or change in lung volume. The effect of
airways obstruction on the dead space volumes was studied in 36
children with asthma and 28 with cystic fibrosis. Physiological dead
space increased with increasing airways obstruction. Anatomical dead
space remained constant in spite of marked increases in lung volume
associated with the airways obstruction.
