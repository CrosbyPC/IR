The aim of this work was to make a preliminary examination of some
hereditary diseases, related to precocious aging in order to
determine whether the defects involved resulted from an impairment of
the DNA repair capacity. To test for an impairment in DNA single
strand capacity, in cells from patients with different diseases, we
have followed the rate of the DNA after X-irradiation by
sedimentation on alkaline sucrose gradients. It was found that all
cells observed from Lesh Nyhan, cystic fibrosis, trisomy 15 et 21,
retinoblastoma, were able to repair the single strand breaks in their
DNA to the same extent and at the same initial rate.
