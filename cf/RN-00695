Insulin and glucagon secretions were studied during oral glucose
tolerance testing and arginine infusion in 13 patients with cystic
fibrosis. Two groups of patients were identified; Group I (N=6) whose
OGTT was entirely normal and Group II (N=7) who had some abnormality
in glucose during OGTT. In each group basal glucagon concentrations
were normal and supressed appropriately (p less than 0.05) after
glucose; insulin responses were attenuated and the peak responses
delayed. During arginine stimulation, insulin secretion was impaired
in each group. However, glucagon secretion was diminished only in
Group II. Thus, insulinopenia was found in both groups and
hyperglucagonemia was not found as a contributory factor to the
hyperglycemia in Group II.
