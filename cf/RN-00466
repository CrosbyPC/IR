Jejunal biopsies were obtained from 37 children with cystic fibrosis,
16 with gluten-induced enteropathy, and 18 control subjects for the
following studies: (1) disaccharidase activity, (2) L-ALA-L-Phe
hydrolase activity, and (3) intestinal uptake of three 14C-labeled
amino acids. Values were significantly reduced in the three
determinations in patients with gluten-induced enteropathy as
compared to control subjects. Lactase and L-ALA-L-Phe hydrolase
activities were significantly reduced (p less than 0.01) in CF
patients as compared to control subjects. Definite hypolactasia was
also observed in 23% of the children with CF. Uptake of lysine was
normal in CF patients whereas that of phenylalanine and cycloleucine
was reduced as compared to control subjects. This study suggests an
intestinal component to the malabsorption of patients with CF.
