The absorption of digoxin in cystic fibrosis was evaluated in 16
subjects by assessing the relationship between dosage expressed in
mug/kg/day and serum digoxin concentration. The results indicate that
the same relationship exists between maintenance dosage and serum
levels in these patients and in patients without cystic fibrosis.
Thus, no evidence of impaired absorption was found.
