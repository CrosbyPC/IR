We report an infant with cystic fibrosis presenting at birth with
meconium ileus who developed prolonged cholestatic jaundice from
compression of the common bile duct and the pancreatic duct by
advanced pancreatic fibrosis.  Extrahepatic biliary obstruction of
this nature has not been previously described in cystic fibrosis.
