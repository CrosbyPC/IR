Infusions of soybean oil emulsion (Intralipid) have been reported to
correct essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiency in patients with cystic
fibrosis of the pancreas.  This article reports the immediate effects
of Intralipid infusion in patients with CF in an attempt to ascertain
through biochemical data whether the use of Intralipid at the
reported dose is free of untoward effects.  Six patients with CF were
placed in a protocol that called for periodic infusions with soybean
oil emulsion containing EFAs.  The first three patients received 2
gm/kg of body weight of Intralipid over a four-hour period.  The
other three patients received half that dose over the same period.
The first three patients developed symptoms of paleness, nausea and
mild discomfort two to three hours after the infusion.  Further
information is needed to determine the best method of correction of
EFA deficiency in children with CF.
