Like Dr Chase and Dr Dupont we have found essential fatty-acid
deficiency, usually subclinical, in cystic fibrosis patients.
However, we feel that their data on prostaglandin synthesis may have
other interpretations.  In patients with deficiency of linoleic
acid, oleic acid is used an alternative substrate; and instead of
dihomogammalinoleic acid, an alternative 20:3 fatty acid is produced.
We have found increased amounts of this substance in the plasma of
patients with cystic fibrosis.  We agree with the authors' conclusion
that levels of linoleic acid are specifically related to P.G.
production in children with cystic fibrosis.  It remains to be shown
whether children with cystic fibrosis have a primary abnormality of
fatty-acid metabolism or whether the observed disturbances of
prostaglandin metabolism are secondary to malabsorption of dietary
essential fatty acids.  In either case, certain clinical features of
the disease may well be explained by prostaglandin disturbances.
