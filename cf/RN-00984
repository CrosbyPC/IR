The coexistence of cystic fibrosis (CF) and coeliac disease (CD) is
reported in eight children, the odds against this occurring in the
same child being 1:2 million to 1:5.9 million.  In Sweden, it would
be around 1:3 million (incidence of CF 1:3000 and of CD 1:1000).
The coexistence of these two diseases is thought to be chance,
although CF might predispose to the development of CD.  In a 10-year
period (with 33405 live births), we observed three children with
exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and small intestine dysfunction.
