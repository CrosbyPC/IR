Brain abscess has only recently been considered a complication of
cystic fibrosis. Three patients are reported here and a fourth cited
from the literature. All of our patients were young adults with
advanced pulmonary disease. The bacteria involved were mouth
organisms and were found in the sputum culture in only one of the
patients. Resistance was present to previously given antibiotics. As
patients with cystic fibrosis survive into adulthood, the risk of
developing a brain abscess appears to increase.
