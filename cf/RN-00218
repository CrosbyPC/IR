Professor R. K. Chandra and others reported significantly increased
levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in the serum of patients with
cystic fibrosis (CF), in the parents of the patients, and in some of
their siblings in Newfoundland, Canada.  The serum AFP levels in our
38 patients with CF were not different from those in healthy adults.
In our opinion, genetic differences cannot explain the different
results concerning the serum AFP levels in patients with CF.
