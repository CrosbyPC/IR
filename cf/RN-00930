Cystic fibrosis screening in the newborn [editorial].

Many attempts have been made to establish a suitable screening test
for cystic fibrosis for newborns.  Recently, a new method has been
described by Crossley and her associates.  It is based on measuring
pancreatic trypsin in a sample of faeces collected on to filter paper
on the 4th or 5th day of life.  The false-negative rate of the new
test has not yet been determined, but older children with CF and
pancreatic achylia all gave abnormal results when tested.  The
disadvantage of the test, as with the meconium albumin test, is that
about 10% of children with CF are said not to have pancreatic
achylia.  Whilst the method needs more extensive evaluation, it
appears technically more satisfactory than others so far described.
