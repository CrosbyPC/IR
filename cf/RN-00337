Insulin iontophoresis in cystic fibrosis.

Insulin and its vehicle without insulin were administered separately
by iontophoresis to patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), obligate
heterozygotes, and healthy controls. The resultant sweat chloride
concentration after treatment with both preparations was compared in
each individual. No difference after the two treatments was found in
the control sample. A decrease in sweat chloride concentration after
insulin iontophoresis in comparison with the vehicle was observed in
both the CF (P smaller than 0.005) and heterozygote (P smaller than
0.01) samples. These observations suggest an involvement of insulin
in CF and a possible role of insulin in sweat gland function.
