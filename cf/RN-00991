Meconium is the first gastrointestinal excretion normally expelled by
the neonate.  This review discusses the composition of meconium:
proteins, lipids, steroid and sterols, bile pigments and bile acids,
glycoproteins, mineral composition, and enzymes.  The major
complications relating to meconium are serious: they include
aspiration pneumonia, which may prove fatal and is not related to
cystic fibrosis, the "meconium plug syndrome" and meconium ileus.
Screening for cystic fibrosis is also examined.
