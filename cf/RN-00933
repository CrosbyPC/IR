A screening test is any diagnostic procedure which we apply without
a specific clinical indication from the point of view of the
individual patient concerned.  Non-selective (whole population)
screening for inborn errors of metabolism, selective screening for
inborn errors of metabolism, screening for nonamino organic
acidurias, and selective screening for inborn errors of metabolism
because of genetic indications are discussed.  The main points which
emerge for the future from this review are the need to develop
multidisease screening programmes to detect the very rare diseases;
that postnatal, prenatal and carrier screening should be considered
and developed collectively; and there us an urgent needs to develop
screening for thallasaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and
congenital hypothyroidism.
