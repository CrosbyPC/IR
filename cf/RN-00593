The Weissenberg rheogoniometer is designed to estimate viscosity at
a single applied shear.  By varying this shear, the associated
detailed variation of viscosity may be studied.  The level of
viscosity depends more on the macroscopic appearance of the sample
than the disease with which it may be associated.  This has
particular significance in relation to cystic fibrosis.  In cystic
fibrosis, the sputum viscosity is not abnormally high.  It is not
higher than that of macroscopically similar sputum from chronic
bronchitis or asthma.  Whatever the feature differentiating cystic
fibrosis from other diseases, it is not the viscosity of the sputum.
