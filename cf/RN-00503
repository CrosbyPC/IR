This review describes the major directions in cystic fibrosis
research in the last nine years.  There have been no further reports
of cystic fibrosis in native African Negroes.  It has been generally
accepted that cystic fibrosis follows simple autosomal recessive
transmission.  It is difficult, however, to explain maintenance of a
lethal gene at such high frequency.  Nothing is known of the
chromosomal localization of the trait.  At present there is no simple
and reliable method of heterozygote detection.  The secretions of
patients with cystic fibrosis are often not copious but exhibit a
peculiar rheologic property.  Several groups have emphasized
decreased water content of cystic fibrosis secretions in the
pathogenesis of the disease.  There is no consistent abnormality of
glycoproteins or glycosaminoglycans to explain why mucus secretions
precipitate and obstruct the organ passages.
