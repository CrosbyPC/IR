In this article, we will examine the reasons for the prolonged
survival of individuals with cystic fibrosis as well as discuss the
pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of this multisystemic disease.
The reasons for the improved prognosis in CF are multiple: improved
antibiotic therapy, early diagnosis, specialized care centers, and
aggressive treatment regimens.  This presents the primary care
physician with a new and challenging patient population, requiring
the coordinated effort of the health care team, including
specialists, nurses, therapists, etc., to achieve effective therapy
for this truly multisystemic disease.
